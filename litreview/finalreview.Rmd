The field of journalism studies is rapidly changing in pace with the development of communications technology and our shifting sociopolitical environment. In order to capture a holistic view of this dynamic landscape, this review used a keyword analysis of all the articles published since 2018 in the journals [Political Communication](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/upcp20/current), [Journalism](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/jou), [Journalism Studies](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rjos20/current), [Digital Journalism](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rdij20/current), [Journalism & Mass Media Quarterly](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/jmq), [International Journal of Press & Politics](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/hij/), and [New Media & Society](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/nms). 

This review uses the data collected from the analysis to inform the Knight Foundation's research program on Trust, Media, and Democracy. In this report, there's a particular focus on the institution's and practice of journalism and news media. The main findings from the keyword analysis are as follows:

1. "Social Media" is the most commonly used keyword (labeling 15.7% of all papers collected), even more so than "journalism" (12.1%) which goes to show the abundant research focused on these technology platforms in recent years.

2. Among methodological keywords, "content analysis" is the most commonly used keyword at 4.7% of all articles, followed by "survey" (1.8%) and "comparative research" (1.4%). 

3. Keywords that are most relevant to Trust, Media, and Democracy that are growing in popularity year-to-year include "audience studies" which went from .2% of all articles in 2018 to being used to label 1.1% of all articles in 2020, as well as "epistemology" (.3% to 1.9%), "public opinion" (.6% to 2.1%), "populism" (.6% to 1.9%), "journalists" (.9% to 2.4%), "digital journalism" (1.7% to 4.1%), "local journalism" (.5% to 1.1%), "trust" (.5% to 1.1%), and "political journalism" (.6% to 1.3%). (There were others but only ones that have >1% of articles in 2020 are included).

4. The three keywords from the above list that have the sharpest increase from 2019 to 2020 include "epistemology" (.58% to 1.9%), "audience studies" (.58% to 1.1%), and "journalists" (1.4% to 2.4%). This may be a leading indicator of growing interest. 

In order to better understand these potential trends, this review will dive into the articles from each year that have these trend keywords to see what the common strand in research may be.
