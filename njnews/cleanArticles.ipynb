      "TRENTON, NJ—Un segmento importante de la población de esta ciudad se verá beneficiada si prospera un Proyecto de Ley que contempla ampliar el derecho a votar, algo que no ocurre desde hace más de 170 años en el estado de New Jersey.\n",
      "La acción presentada el pasado cinco de marzo por los senadores Ronald Rice y Sandra Cunningham, ha sido denominada S-2100 y concedería el derecho a votar a las personas condenadas por delitos graves que gozan del beneficio de libertad condicional o que cumplen sentencias.\n",
      "La propuesta es una versión de la A-3456, patrocinada por las Asambleístas Shavonda Sumter y Cleopatra Tucker, la cual fue presentada en la Cámara Baja de la Legislatura de New Jersey.\n",
      "Cunningham dice que su Proyecto de Ley ayudaría a más de 94,000 personas que perdieron el derecho al voto debido a una condena. La mayoría de estas personas, casi 73,000 viven en la comunidad, pero no pueden votar legalmente porque actualmente están en libertad condicional.\n",
      "Las otras personas afectadas actualmente están encarceladas. De acuerdo al Proyecto de Ley, estos reclusos podrán votar a traves de una boleta por correo en las elecciones, las que serían enviadas a los centros de internamiento, de acuerdo a las áreas donde vivían antes de su encarcelamiento.\n",
      "“No hay evidencia de que negar el derecho de voto a las personas con condenas penales sirve para ningun proposito legitimo de seguridad pública”, dice el proyecto de ley. “Denegar el derecho a votar a personas con condenas penales carga innecesariamente a la policía, funcionarios electorales y residentes de New Jersey”, indica Cunningham.\n",
      "Casi la mitad de las personas a las que se les niega el derecho a votar son afroamericanos que constituyen el 15 por ciento de la población del estado. Por tal motivo, el Black Caucus Legislativo de New Jersey y el Instituto de Justicia Social de Justicia de New Jersey llevaron a cabo una conferencia de prensa el 26 de febrero en el Congreso estatal para promover la legislación antes mencionada.\n",
      " El anuncio coincidió con el aniversario de la modificación en 1869 de la Enmienda número 15 de la Constitución de los Estados Unidos que prohíbe a los Estados negar el derecho al voto “por motivos de raza,color o condición previa de servidumbre”.\n",
      "La acción para cambiar la ley se conoce como “1844 No Más” porque New Jersey prohibió votar a personas con condenas penales cuando ratificó una nueva Constitución Estatal en 1844, la que restringe el derecho al voto de los hombres blancos.\n",
      "Hoy en día,irónicamente es a las personas afroamericanas en New Jersey que se les niega el derecho al voto debido a una condena criminal, lo que atrajo la atención de los defensores de la propuesta, quienes señalan una grave disparidad racial en su población carcelaria a pesar de las tasas similares de ofensa entre blanco y negro residentes.\n",
      "El Senador Rice dice que el proyecto de Ley fue presentado en la conferencia de prensa en lugar de hacerlo en el Senado o en la Asamblea porque el mismo era para el pueblo de New Jersey. Sin embargo, los patrocinadores del proyecto no están seguros de si el mismo contará con el apoyo del Presidente del Senado Estatal, Steve Sweeney, el Presidente de la Asamblea, Craig Coughlin o del Gobernador Phil Murphy, pero aseguraron tener esperanzas de que el mismo sea aprobado\n",
      "Ron Pierce, un veterano y estudiante actual de la Universidad de Rutgers, quien perdió el derecho al voto cuando fue declarado culpable de un delito de primer grado en 1986, dice que permitir que la gente en prisión vote es importante para la rehabilitación porque les da voz.\n",
      "Pierce cree que cuando una persona inicia un diálogo significativo sobre las preocupaciones cívicas, ve más allá de sus necesidades personales y cambia el enfoque respecto a su comunidad.\n",
      "El Alcalde de Hoboken, Ravi, Bhalla, quien se unió a otros líderes electos durante la comparecencia ante los medios de comunicación, señaló que las leyes actuales tienen su base cuando la esclavitud aún era legal.\n",
      "El Presidente de la Unión de Libertades Civiles de New Jersey (ACLU-NJ) por sus siglas en inglés, Amol Sinha, indicó que en el pasado, New Jersey en el mejor de los casos, perpetuaba una injusticia desde 1844 sin pensarlo y, en el peor de los casos, desautorizaba deliberadamente y sistemáticamente a las personas.\n",
      "Ryan Haygood, Presidente del Instituto de Justicia Social de New Jersey, expresa que aunque mucha gente ve los estados sureños como los únicos lugares que excluyen a las personas afroamericanas de sus derechos civiles, en New Jersey, un niño afroamericano es 30 veces más posibilidades de ser encarcelado que un niño blanco, en tanto que un adulto afroamericano tiene 12 veces más probabilidades de ser encarcelado que un adulto blanco, a pesar de los datos que muestran que los adultos y niños blancos y afroamericanos cometen crímenes al mismo tiempo.\n",
      "El Reverendo Charles Boyer dijo que New Jersey es uno de los estados más progresistas de la Nación. Según Boyer, el Estado Jardín pasa de un sistema de justicia penal a un sistema de justicia restaurativa si comienza a otorgar el derecho de voto a todos.\n",
      "Finalmente, Cunningham asegura que mientras otros estados quitan los derechos de voto, New Jersey puede convertirse en un líder dentro de una democracia más justa e inclusiva. La Corporación de Reingreso de New Jersey, (NJRC) por sus siglas en inglés, es una agencia sin fines de lucro que ayuda a individuos involucrados en casos judiciales,abrió un “centro de reingreso” en Middlesex en New Brunswick en febrero pasado.\n",
      "La Agencia está localizada en el número 57 de Livingston Avenue, en el mismo edificio donde funciona el New Millenium Bank y el Centro Comunitario Lazos America Unida y su objetivo es trabajar para ayudar a este segmento de la población ayudándoles con oportunidades de capacitación y empleo.\n",

      "Not often has there been a clarion call, a harkening and lyceum for people, viewers and patrons to proceed with action.  Bennie Boom’s soon to be released movie on Tupac Shakur entitled “All Eyez on Me” is surely the suggest to do so.\n",
      "\n",
      "The value proposition is that it is important to support this film as the opus reconsideration of Black males as Endangered Species and America Most Wanted.  I know that this is the period of enlightenment which warrants a film like this as a social paradigm shifting. It is the circumstance of work left undone.  Bennie knows well about the male experience, he has long since joined the ranks of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity Inc., the first black male greek lettered organization to be founded in the United States of America.\n",

      "\n",
      "I stress the belief that “Black Lives Matter” and “All Eyez on Me” is the summation that Hip Hop has and will always matter as a fact floundering and missing pages of black males as a species and gender.  I have known Bennie Boom from his student enrollment days at Temple University and his Philly tenure which included a peer group of prominent figures such as Grammy Award winner Jill Scott and Tony Award winner Black Ice.  As a faculty member in Temple University’s Pan-African Studies / Community Education Program, I was blessed to have a leading role in his senior year film project that also featured Lois Moses, bestselling, award winning and critically acclaimed writer of books, films, plays and spoken recordings. The need assessment is for everybody, everyplace, elsewhere and anyhow of local, national and abroad to become talking heads and agent provocateurs for this purposeful film that will be released on June 16th, which is three days before the annual emancipation celebration of Juneteenth’s dateline of June 19th. This film should not be referred to as the refrain and lasting namesake of failure, such as the most recent Broadway play that mainstream and hip hop generational audiences refused to attend during its brief theatrical stint on the Great White Way of New York.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Let all of us be diligent, dutiful and participatory in contacting all of our friends, family members, constituents, neighbors, comrades, colleagues, associates, co-workers, siblings, relatives and offspring about the importance of this literary and cinematography expression presented by Bennie Boom. You still have time to make a call, text, email and even go the official website and download promotional material to post in the hangouts of bars, barbershops, beauty salons, laundromats, supermarkets, pool halls and other frequent and routine gathering places. The internet is the distinctive factor to explore the significance of this film especially through the footnotes provided in social media analysis “7 Revelations about the Tupac Shakur Biopic from Director Bennie Boom.” Let’s make sure that we put the word out as most importance through social fabrics of tweet, Facebook, Instagram and all other connectors to listservs, websites, chat sites, meet-up groups, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Lets use all of our current strands of outreach to motivate those contingent of groups, organizations, facilities, centers, secret societies, institutions and bodies of socialization to put the word out about this landmark and pivotal historical event when Bennie Boom’s film, “All Eyez on Me,” is released on June 16, 2017. Check the internet and go to the official website of the film or its director and keep them posted of your progressive intentions.\n",

      "By Jerry Del Priore  On September 13th, the Mayo Performing Arts Center (MPAC) kicked off its 25th anniversary with a fabulous concert by singer/actress and American Idol finalist Katherine McPhee. MPAC, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, has been at the center of Morristown’s revitalization and is a major reason why it’s a nightlife hotspot today, with several wonderful bars and restaurants lining its lively streets since its inception, according to General Manager Ed Kirchdoerffer. “Twenty-five years ago, Morristown wasn’t the popular town it is now,” Kirchdoerffer, a Morristown native, said. “We feel the opening of the performing arts center was part of the rebuilding of Morristown. It’s been an anchor for improvement.” Top musical and comedic acts have performed at MPAC over the years, from Foreigner and Daughtry to Melissa Ethridge and Wayne Brady, and every great entertainer in between. Moreover, MPAC doesn’t have any plans of slowing down any time soon. Musical performers such as America, Kenny G, Joan Jett and the Blackhearts and Ruben Studdard will be hitting the stage in October. “We feel we’re still in a growth cycle,” Kirchdoerffer said. “We constantly challenge ourselves to grow and invest in ourselves to make the best possible events.”  Kirchdoerffer said some of the ways MPAC will be celebrating its 25 years in Morristown are by holding a few free concerts, ask its performance-goers, on social media, to name their favorite moments since its opening, and have a number of $25 ticket offers, to name a few.  However, MPAC is more than a concert hall for some of today’s greatest acts. It also offers a Performing Arts School (PAS), founded in 2006, which now serves approximately 700 students per year with over 20 classes a week within a supportive and creative atmosphere. Students ages five to 18 come from all over Northern New Jersey to learn performance technique while building confidence and having a great time. Classes are offered in musical theatre, acting, singing technique, song presentation, improvisation, private voice and adult cabaret. “The emphasis isn’t placed on being a star,” Kirchdoerffer explained. “It’s placed on being part of a team, being part of the creative process. They really get a full immersive experience. Everyone’s so encouraging of everyone else.” While most of the kids don’t enter the entertainment world, Kirchdoerffer noted that they will gain valuable skills that will help them succeed in life. “Most won’t go on to become performers,” he said, “but they will learn important life skills that will go a long way, whether it’s in the boardroom or other areas of work.”Additionally, MPAC offers The Miracle Project, a fully inclusive music and theatre program for children with autism of all levels. “It’s been a very powerful program,” Kirchdoerffer said. “This is a program that grew organically. Many parents have spoken about (their experiences) and are happy to see their kids enjoy themselves. This (program) gives them a safe haven. They get to have fun while being themselves.” There’s also an Art Upstairs Gallery, located in the balcony lobby of MPAC, which showcases visual artists from a variety of disciplines, including watercolor, oils, photography, sculpture and more. Each year, the works of over 200 artists are showcased in group exhibits. Each display hangs from six to eight weeks.With all the success MPAC has experienced over the last 25 years, Kirchdoerffer said he hopes to see more prosperous years ahead for the Morristown institution, which has been a staple in the thriving town. “We have been here for 25 years and hope to do it for 25 more years and beyond,” he said. “It’s been the town’s heartbeat.” For more information on MPAC’s educational programs, Art Upstairs Gallery, and a list of upcoming performances, go to www.mayoarts.org. Mayo Performing Arts Center Celebrates 25 Years of Prosperity  added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "By Henry M. HoldenThe Morristown Festival of Books is an annual two-day event that takes place this year on October 11 and 12. According to Rachel Barry, Director of the Morristown Festival of Books, “The 6-year-old event is modeled after successful book festivals in other communities throughout the world. Each autumn, the festival brings together authors with readers and book lovers. The Festival is New Jersey’s premier book festival, celebrating the written word’s power to challenge, transport and transform.” Barry says the festival is growing each year. “We started with about 1,500 visitors six years ago and last year we hosted over 8,000.”The opening night is a ticketed Keynote Event featuring Preet Bharara who served as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York from 2009 to 2017. In 2017, Bharara joined the NYU School of Law faculty as a Distinguished Scholar in Residence. Bharara will speak on Friday evening at the Mayo Performing Arts Center at 7:30pm. Tickets will be available through the MPAC box office and on the festival website. Tickets are also available at the door on the night of the event, as availability allows.The Main Festival takes place all day on Saturday (10 a.m. – 5 p.m.), rain or shine.This year’s festival features more than 50 authors. Author selections featuring various genres are designed to appeal to a variety of ages and reading interests. “Authors will be speaking and answering questions in informal one-hour indoor sessions at five festival venues throughout the day,” said Barry. “Immediately following his or her talk, you will have the opportunity to speak with your favorite authors and have your books personalized at the Author Signing Tent, on the Vail Mansion lawn.” These sessions are free, no tickets required; general seating is on a first-come, first-served basis. There will also be portable restrooms at the Vail Mansion lawn. “The Festival center is on the lawn in front of the historic Vail Mansion (110 South Street), where there is an Information Tent, a Book Tent selling copies of the visiting authors’ books, the Signing Tent where authors will greet visitors and sign books, and concession stands selling refreshments.”“This year’s closing event is an exciting interactive event called Pitchapalooza,” said Barry. “It’s like American Idol for books (only without Simon). Anyone with an idea for a book has the chance to pitch it to a panel of judges. But they get only one minute.”The hosts, Arielle Eckstut and David Henry Sterry (a.k.a. The Book Doctors) team up with guest industry insiders to form the judging panel. The Judges critique everything from idea to style to potential in the marketplace and much more. Whether potential authors pitch themselves, or simply listen to trained professionals critique each presentation, Pitchapaloozas are educational and entertaining for all. All attendees come away with concrete advice on how to improve their pitch as well as a greater understanding of the ins and outs of the publishing industry.At the end of each Pitchapalooza, the judges come together to pick a winner. That winner receives an introduction by Eckstut and Sterry to an agent or publisher who is appropriate for their work. The Festival audience will also have a chance to pick a winning pitch. That Audience Choice winner will be voted on by the audience and will receive a 30-minute phone consultation from Eckstut and Sterry (a $150 value).KidFest @ MFOB includes author talks, signings, and fun activities all day for children up to 12 years old. Additionally, concessions will be available in the KidFest outdoor area outside the Presbyterian Church Parish House at 65 South Street. Please note, the festival is not held on the Morristown Green. There are several public parking garages within walking distance of the Festival center. This is a casual event. Wear comfortable walking shoes and be prepared for cool weather. It is a rain or shine event, so please bring an umbrella if the day’s weather warrants it. For more information and a list of authors attending see: www.morristownbooks.orgThe Morristown Festival of Books is Back added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "By: Michele DiPasquale To some, a library may be a thing of the past; but in fact, libraries are currently visited much more frequently than one might think. And public libraries can still proclaim that they are not only crucial to the populace for offering the enjoyment of reading for free, but for the very relevant and contemporary services they provide. In fact, a recent survey showed that, since 2016, 53% of Millennials say they used a library at least twice in any given year, and that number is actually higher when comparing it to 45% of Gen Xers and 43% of Baby Boomers who were simultaneously polled. So even in today’s online world, the public library is still absolutely in demand. Catherine Tinger GoldbergThere are public libraries for children, adolescents, teens, and adults, but the very first library for your very young child, is, in fact, First Library® of Morristown. At First Library new mothers and parents can borrow books and other materials, make use of reference collections, enjoy computer services, and encourage early literacy and the joy of reading.  “The idea to start First Library® came to me after my friend, Diane, had her first child. I wanted to give my love of reading to her and her newborn, so I sent her some books to read to her baby son, Lubin. Diane later explained that she was having a hard time finding English-language children’s books to read to him and that my books were the perfect gift for a new first-time mother (from the United States living in France). So I began sending her a new children’s book every month – many were childhood favorites of my own children. Diane would call or write to say how she, and later her son, happily anticipated the arrival of their monthly book and the joy they received reading it together, and how they both looked forward to reading time,” shared Catherine Tinger Goldberg, founder and director of First Library®. She felt that if a book could bring so much happiness, joy, and comfort to just one child, how much could it bring to multiple children? It was then that she decided to create First Library®. By taking a cue from Dolly Parton and her Imagination Library program, Ms. Tinger Goldberg followed Ms. Parton’s idea. The Imagination Library was created in 1995 for in-need children in Ms. Parton’s native Tennessee. The purpose was and is for each child, regardless of gender, race, or income, to register at the Imagination Library program and receive a free book each month until the age of five, paid for by Ms. Parton’s Dollywood Foundation®. While it began for children in need in Tennessee, Ms. Parton, by the year 2000, allowed and promoted the replication of the program to other states.  In order to promote local library patronage, First Library® became more than a free monthly book program. Ms. Tinger Goldberg devised a curriculum for first-time mothers in need that was tailored to their and their firstborn child’s special circumstances. The curriculum would give first-time parents in need the First Library® book program (or other books) and gently-used clothing and educational toys during their child’s first three years of life, free of charge, by requiring parents to read to their child daily and submit a reading log each month.  First Library® was developed for first-time mothers and their child’s individual needs and wants. First Library offers the newborn children of first-time mothers, regardless of gender, race, or income, up to 60 free, brand new, age-appropriate books, until the child is the age of five, at no cost or financial obligation to their families. Books are mailed monthly to the child’s home. At First Library there’s also a story hour, craft time, educational presentations, summer reading programs, and family-oriented events are held frequently. The First Library® program offers first-time mothers, the majority in need, additional free books during their child’s first three years of life through various free reading-related activities (beyond the First Library’s program daily reading and monthly library visits) to shop quarterly for free gifts at the online book store, More First Library® Shop. “All we ask is that parents read to their child daily and maintain regular library patronage,” Ms. Tinger Goldberg explained.  “Essentially we are a free book program but sometimes more than a book a month is necessary to bring the importance of regular reading and books into a home. For children born under the poverty level there are new educational toys and clothing available for the parents,” Ms. Tinger Goldberg said. “I feel it is so important for children to be read to early and consistently. Children should have a firm foundation for a lifetime love of reading, respect for literature, and an appreciation for all things the library has to offer. I hope I am achieving these goals with First Library®,” Ms. Tinger Goldberg explained. Because First Library is in five counties and growing throughout the State of New Jersey, aside from receptions at their offices, they rely on individual community members and Community Actions teams to spread the word about First Library’s mission and fundraising efforts. They do accept monetary donations on behalf of the donor’s community through Classy.org. First Library is also an approved charity of the AmazonSmile program. “What parents and other community members are starting to realize is that if we help all children, whether they are less fortunate or not, learn to read early and on a consistent basis, we are helping everyone in their class, school, and community,” she shared. First Library is available in Livingston, Carteret, Edison, North Brunswick, Port Reading, Sewaren, Perrineville, Cedar Knolls, Chatham Borough, Chatham Township, Green Village, Morristown, New Vernon, Whippany, Somerset, and Basking Ridge.  First Library Will Help Build Libraries of Babies added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "How To Combat Cold And Flu(NAPSI)—According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), chances are good you’ll get a cold or the flu this year. Adults have an average of two to three colds per year and children have even more, while 5 to 20 percent of the population gets the flu. Fortunately, there are steps you can take to minimize your risk and ease your symptoms.Consider these tips from Chloraseptic® pharmacist spokesperson Maria Mantione:• Get a flu shot. The CDC recommends a flu shot for everyone over the age of 6 months. It’s easy to get—just talk to your pharmacist. It’s the best way to prevent the spread of the flu. It does not prevent the common cold, but the flu is a devastating, serious illness that could put you out of commission for a week or more or, even worse, land you in the hospital with pneumonia or infect someone you love with a weaker immune system—such as babies, the elderly or those undergoing chemotherapy.• Wash your hands often. Washing your hands with soap and water is the best way to prevent the spread of the common cold.• Prevent illness by practicing healthy habits. Make sure to get enough sleep, eat a balanced, nutritious diet, exercise and minimize stress.• If you do get sick, talk to your pharmacist about how to manage your symptoms with medications. Before cold season, stock your medicine cabinet with the essentials. Stick to single-ingredient products, so you have what you need to treat your specific symptoms. These include pain relievers and fever reducers, a decongestant, cough medicine, lozenges and a sore throat spray. Topical medications, such as Chloraseptic sore throat sprays and lozenges, are great to have on hand because they’re portable, can be used safely with other cold medicines and have very few side effects.In fact, Chloraseptic is the No. 1 sore throat relief brand around. It provides fast-acting relief for sore throats and mouth pain to help you get through your day.From lozenges that soothe nasal passages and suppress coughs to sprays that target pain when and where it hurts, there’s a broad portfolio of products based on your preferences and needs.The lozenges have a soothing liquid center that relieves pain and cools nasal passages. MAX Wild Berry is the strongest throat relief lozenge in the line. Chloraseptic Total offers a multisymptom lozenge formula that can suppress your cough for up to four hours.Chloraseptic’s sprays are the No. 1 pharmacist-recommended brand. The new and improved Cherry Spray tastes great, works on contact and is free of aspirin, sugar and gluten. The MAX Wild Berry Targeted Throat Spray is convenient for travel or to keep in your purse. The targeted spray makes it easier when you’re on the go to coat and protect specific areas in your mouth and throat. All these products are available at mass retailers, major drugstores and grocery stores.Also helping to keep you ahead of the flu this season is an online Cold + Flu tracker. To check for outbreaks and symptoms, go to www.chloraseptic.com, click on Cold + Flu Tracker and enter your zip code.How To Combat Cold And Flu added by new_view_media on December 22, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Helping Older People to Maintain Independence(NAPSI)—For most older adults, the ability to live independently is associated with the ability to drive. That’s one reason the prospect of eventually “giving up the keys” can be a frightening one.To help, the experts on aging at the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging (n4a) developed a brochure called “Before You Give Up the Keys: Create a Roadmap for Transportation Independence” that may lessen those fears by empowering older adults to evaluate their mobility needs, identify the transportation options in their community and develop a plan customized to their unique circumstances.“A too-familiar scenario is that older adults wait until they’re involved in some sort of emergency, like a traffic accident, before they really think about their driving ability and the other transportation options available to them in their community,” said n4a CEO Sandy Markwood. “Our goal is to shed light on a critical issue that will likely affect most families with an older loved one who may need to limit or eliminate their driving, and to provide a catalyst for discussion, and hopefully, action,” Markwood also noted.The n4a represents America’s national network of 623 Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs). It helps older adults and people with disabilities live with dignity and choices in their homes and communities for as long as possible.To that end, it created the Eldercare Locator. This serves as an essential, trusted gateway to help older adults, caregivers and health professionals navigate the maze of aging programs and services, as well as to assist them in identifying and accessing the resources that match their needs best. The National Call Center operates five days a week from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET and can be reached at 800-677-1116 or www.eldercare.gov.According to recent research by the Federal Transit Administration, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, n4a and the National Aging and Disability Transportation Center, the rise in the 65-plus population—some 45 million and growing—has triggered a corresponding spike in the number of nondrivers of more than 1.1 million between 2001 and 2009.“This is a major issue for older adults because when they lack access to transportation, they can’t get to the doctor, the grocery store or see friends and family as much, which means their overall well-being is likely to suffer,” added Kathy Greenlee, Assistant Secretary for Aging.Free BrochureTo download the free brochure, go to www.n4a.org/files/ResourcesforOlderAdults.pdf.

      "Protect Your Health, Protect Your Toothbrush(NAPSI)—Did you know that keeping your toothbrush clean is a simple way to help protect your health and the health of your loved ones year-round, and especially during flu season?Dentists’ Advice for the Entire FamilyAccording to pediatric dentist Danielle Gilbert-Fowler, D.M.D., “Oral health is not just about your mouth, it’s about your overall health. The mouth is a major doorway for all sorts of microorganisms, which can be linked to anything from the common cold to heart disease and diabetes. Hence, the importance of having a healthy mouth cannot be overstated.”“More than 300 kinds of microorganisms thrive in the human mouth,” explains Astrid Shroetter, D.D.S. “What’s more, the typical toothbrush is reused for months and never cleaned thoroughly.”Research indicates that kids get sick on average about 10 times a year—that’s almost once a month. While dentists and parents both encourage good oral hygiene, it would be nice to do so without worrying about potential reinfection caused by brushing teeth with contaminated toothbrushes. As Dr. Gilbert-Fowler puts it, “You wouldn’t clean your house with a dirty washcloth. Why clean your teeth with a dirty toothbrush?”A Solution“It’s important to keep toothbrushes in a clean environment and separate from other toothbrushes,” recommends Gilbert-Fowler. “Use of a Steripod® clip-on toothbrush protector will help keep your toothbrush clean and protect against outside contaminants and cross contamination from other toothbrushes. It’s important for kids and adults alike to replace toothbrushes every three months or more frequently after any illness.”Developed by doctors and independently tested for efficacy at an accredited lab, Steripod is a clip-on protector that fits any standard or electric toothbrush. Using a patented natural vapor shield of thymol, derived from the thyme plant, Steripod keeps toothbrushes fresh and clean for up to three months. Simply clip it on your electric or manual toothbrush and it goes to work; no cables or batteries are needed. You can use it at home, work, the gym, school or when you travel.More Pearls of Wisdom for Your Pearly Whites:To further put the bite on dental disease, heed these five tips from the experts at the American Dental Association:1. Brush your teeth twice a day for two minutes with a soft-bristled brush.2. Replace your toothbrush every three or four months, or if the bristles are frayed.3. Use an ADA-accepted fluoride toothpaste.4. Clean between teeth daily with floss.5. Visit your dentist regularly for professional cleanings and oral exams.Learn MoreVisit www.GetSteripod.com or call (310) 204-7880.Protect Your Health, Protect Your Toothbrush added by new_view_media on December 22, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "6 Tips for Planning Your Wedding Photos Like a Pro\n",
      "Five words or less(NewsUSA) – With everything that goes into your wedding day, those once-in-a-lifetime moments will go by in a blur, which is why hiring a professional wedding photographer is a must. After all, the last thing you should be worrying about is whether your photographer will be able to capture your big day.\n",
      "The key? Prepare yourself so that you can accurately evaluate the “right” photographer for you.\n",
      "“The best photographer will take the time to build a rapport with you and use his or her experience and creativity to capture the mood, personality, ambiance and even the geography of your wedding,” says PPA (Professional Photographers of America) photographer Berit Bizjak. “The finest wedding photography is more than a series of still pictures. It’s physical poetry — it tells the story of the day and portrays the essence of both people and place.”\n",
      "To this end, PPA, the largest international nonprofit association created by professional photographers, has taken the guesswork out of the process by offering six tips to help you plan your wedding photos like a pro:\n",
      "1. Book far in advance. The best photographers get booked quickly — sometimes as much as a year in advance — so don’t wait until the last minute to book your photographer.\n",
      "2. Show them the money. Now is not the time to skimp on your photo budget. Call around and get a price range for services, and remember: after the cake is long gone, and the dress is stored away, your wedding photos will be the only things left to share and enjoy for years to come, so don’t cut too many corners on your photography budget — you’ll end up regretting it.\n",
      "3. Make sure your photographer is a real pro. Only hire someone who has liability insurance, experience taking the style of photos you want, backup equipment and a plan for when things go south. Ideally, he or she is a PPA photographer. PPA photographers do more than just snap pictures. They have the technical expertise and artistry to make you look your best and bring your vision to life. They also abide by a strict code of ethics that makes a real difference. Watch this (video) to see real married couples share their stories.\n",
      "4. Request to see a full gallery of real weddings. Look at full wedding coverage (not just a small selection of each wedding’s best moments) to see a photographer’s true style and get a sense of how he or she might tell your “story.” Do you prefer more artistic or traditional poses? Would you rather have a photojournalist approach or a mix of all styles?\n",
      "5.Work with your photographer to create a detailed shot list. PPA wedding photographers can also help you create that shot list, as they know what key moments tell a wedding story and can prepare for those. But talk about your must-haves, and walk through the entire program with your photographer ahead of time. Share your expectations ahead of time to ensure that he or she captures the key shots, while remaining attentive and available to catch the best candid moments.\n",
      "6. Plan your post-wedding photo strategy• ahead of time! Almost as soon as the festivities are over, you’ll be eager to look at the photos so you can relive your big day over and over again. Ask your photographer for teasers or a “sneak peek” and a timeline for when the rest of the pictures will be available. Will they give you an online gallery for family and friends to choose the images they want? Again, knowing these things ahead of time will make things easy on the back end, sparing you any heartache.6 Tips for Planning Your Wedding Photos Like a Pro added by new_view_media on December 22, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Wedding Gifts for Grooms: A Tradition Brides Shouldn’t Ignore\n",
      "Five words or less(NewsUSA) – The answer is: Yes, it’s expected.\n",
      "But it’s also a chance for all you brides out there to truly show you know that not everything is about you on your wedding day. That there really is another person involved (that would be the groom) who deserves a bit of recognition, too.\n",
      "We’re talking wedding presents — specifically, yours to your husband-to-be.\n",
      "Tradition does, indeed, hold that both you and he exchange gifts. And while it’s true that some guys are initially shocked to learn your engagement ring doesn’t also count as a “present,” that’s no excuse for you to waver.\n",
      "“Giving him something that’s just for him will make him feel really special,” advises BrideBox.com.\n",
      "Here’s what you need to know now that it’s prime time for weddings:\n",
      "* When to exchange them. Etiquette dictates that the hand-off occurs at one of three times: the night before the wedding, the morning of the ceremony, or right before leaving on your honeymoon. Think it’s bad luck to see the groom before the nuptials? “Many couples choose to courier gifts via bridesmaids or groomsmen just before the ceremony,” says Brides.com.\n",
      "* There’s a thin line between “romantic” and “mushy.” Some of you may be tempted to compile a “love notes” journal of every bit of correspondence you’ve ever sent your groom. Even assuming he’s the type who wouldn’t consider that a bit “over the top,” there’s always the chance he might be left wondering, “Okay, where’s my real present?”– especially if his gift to you is a serious piece of jewelry.\n",
      "* The consensus choice. There’s a reason a watch invariably makes everyone’s short list: It’s the perfect statement of who he is or aspires to be. (It’s also a lot more impressive than a flask, which for some reason also gets a few votes).\n",
      "No less a taste arbiter than MarthaStewartWeddings.com favors Baume & Mercier’s Clifton line — as elegant as the original 1950s model that inspired it — for the way it “easily transitions from big day to every day.” Like the Swiss watchmaker’s timelessly charming (and affordably luxurious) Classima line, it comes with a choice of straps, dial faces and a variety of what’s known as “small complications” that go way beyong just telling the hour. You can shop them at the Baume & Mercier e-boutique or by calling 1-800-MERCIER, where free engraving and wrapping are available.\n",
      "* Fun fact. One writer at AskMen.com says he’s “heard of women giving their husbands watches in the ceremony instead of a wedding ring.” If so, the answer is: No, just like your engagement ring, that wouldn’t also qualify as a wedding present.Wedding Gifts for Grooms: A Tradition Brides Shouldn’t Ignore added by new_view_media on December 22, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "The Many Colors of Love: Engagement Rings Get a Makeover\n",
      "WeddingDollarsCYou can thank Kim Kardashian and Kanye West for setting the bar so high when it comes to getting married.The average cost of a wedding — sans a honeymoon — has now soared to more than $31,000, according to the wedding planning website TheKnot. And experts say the “images of celebrity wedding extravagance,” a la last year’s $12 million “Kimye” nuptials in Florence, Italy, are influencing couples’ spending choices.Another reason for the jump, experts say, are the engagement rings.“People want big rings like the ones celebrities wear,” says Jason Kordvani, president of product development at Davani (davanijewelry.com), a family-owned company specializing in colored gemstones that has an almost 50-year reputation for creating some of the most gorgeous engagement rings around.Obviously, you don’t have to shell out that much to have the wedding of your dreams. But with this being the prime time for popping the question — 39 percent of all marriage proposals occur between Thanksgiving and Valentine’s Day — there is one trend that’s become both a must and a potential money-saving opportunity.Personalization, experts say, is on the rise.Here’s what we mean:• The engagement ring. If you’ve been reading the glossies, you know that celebs like Elizabeth Hurley and Jessica Simpson are breaking from tradition and wearing engagement rings with colored gemstones. Not only does this take fashion to a whole new level, but colored gemstones have also become a way to customize an engagement ring. And while it needn’t be her birthstone — Simpson’s is ruby, but Hurley’s sapphire jibes with the month her then-fiance was born — the right romantic touch can make for the ultimate in personalization.“It can also be the month a couple met or her favorite color,” says Kordvani.Whether sapphire, emerald, ruby or some other stone, Kordvani notes, couples are also often pleasantly surprised to discover they can get a “larger, more important-looking ring at much less cost than a diamond.” Davani Jewelry itself offers styles ranging from the more affordable Davani Bridal to the show-stopping Luxury Collection.• The reception. The bad news here is that spending on cocktail hours jumped 7 percent. So think signature cocktails rather than an open bar.• The wedding venue. “When couples get married, they’re really looking for interesting, unusual details,” Lorin Holmes, co-founder of VermontWeddings.com told USA Today. All things considered, the $50,000 price tag to hold a reception at the New York Public Library— anything cultural or historic is also hot — makes the average venue booking fee of $14,000 a little less jaw dropping.For more information, visit www.davanijewelry.com.The Many Colors of Love: Engagement Rings Get a Makeover added by new_view_media on December 22, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Want to Increase Revenue? Take Your Business Global(NAPSI)—International selling may seem daunting, but thanks to the Internet, it’s more attainable than ever. With the right tools in place, small businesses can go global and increase revenues without the headache.The question then is, “Where should I sell?” Consider these two destinations as you map out your plan for international growth:CanadaCanadians are e-commerce enthusiasts—in fact, 60 percent of Canada’s online shoppers buy from U.S.-based sellers. As an added bonus, there’s typically no language barrier for U.S. businesses selling into Canada.Given this opportunity for U.S. small businesses, the U.S. Postal Service opted to create zone-based pricing for all Priority Mail International® shipments headed to Canada starting on May 31, 2015.This means that the USPS will charge for shipping based on the U.S. origin ZIP code and the Canada destination postal code, instead of blending expensive routes into one flat rate.There will now be seven pricing zones for shipping. Some rates will increase, but for businesses in major cities—such as San Francisco, Miami and Chicago—savings will be around $8 per package.BrazilLatin America is the world’s second-fastest-growing e-commerce market, and leading this boom is Brazil. With 202 million citizens, of whom 33.5 million shop online, Brazil presents a huge opportunity for U.S.-based businesses looking to expand, though it’s not without its challenges.Due to delays in customs clearance, postal packages could take up to 20 days to arrive. Duties and taxes, as well as complicated custom forms, slow the process for both U.S. merchants and the buyers.However, there are solutions. Shipping technology company Endicia just launched a program called Endicia Global Service, which allows shipments from U.S. businesses to reach Brazilian customers in as little as 8 days. Additionally, duties and taxes can be paid by the buyer up front, and there are no complicated customs forms to fill out.“International selling is a great way to grow a business and secure additional revenue,” said Endicia co-founder and general manager Amine Khechfé. “These markets in particular are undergoing massive growth, and there’s never been a better time for small businesses to look into them.”To learn about the tools you need to succeed in going global, check out www.endicia.com/go-global.Want to Increase Revenue?

      "(BPT) – Remember free time? You used to have so much of it. But these days, work and family obligations have you running around constantly and you don’t know what to do first. You don’t even have time to do everything you have to do, let alone what you want to do.So how do you take back your day? How do you find the time to get things done and bring back some semblance of order? It is possible if you focus on making yourself more efficient. To help you accomplish all of your goals and find some free time as well, here are four ways you can improve your efficiency every single day.* Make a plan. When you’re running through your list of daily obligations the morning of, it’s easy to forget a thing or two, especially if you have children running around, phones ringing or dogs barking to distract you. Instead, plan out the upcoming day the night before. Make a list of everything you have to do and check these items against one another. Can two trips be combined? Are you prioritizing the most important things first? The better you can plan out your schedule, the more organized you’ll be the next day.* Get the news and information you need ASAP. You are bombarded by digital content every day and some of it is really important – but who has time to sift through it all? To help you find the information you need as quickly as possible, Fresly LLC launched a new app, iNews Photo. Whether you are on the go, or gathering news in your office this application allows you access to global and local news curated in real time by former journalist directly to your mobile phone or on a larger screen.* Set priorities. You don’t have time to do it all and maybe you don’t have to. Sit down and make a list of every social or professional group and obligation you belong to. Once you’ve made the list, look at it and ask yourself honestly how important this obligation is to you or your family. If you find the obligation is not essential, you’re better off to abandon it and save your time for the responsibilities that are more important to you.* Limit multitasking. Many people look to multitasking as an efficiency solution, but doing several things at once means it takes longer to accomplish any one task. And when the first task is completed, the result is often poorer because of it. Instead of trying to do several things at once, focus on the most important thing, accomplish it and move on.With today’s hectic schedules, finding the opportunity to do everything you’re supposed to do may seem impossible. However, if you apply the four tips listed above, you’ll improve your efficiency, stay up on the latest news and maybe even discover that elusive free time you sorely deserve. To learn more about how the iNews Photo app can help you find all of the information you need when you need it, and to download the app at Play.Google.com or iTunes.Apple.com, using the following code OGV1015.The 4-step plan to make your day more efficient added by new_view_media on November 15, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "medical workers working together in hospital(BPT) – Over the last decade, a number of changes have transformed the healthcare industry. The Affordable Care Act has enabled more than 16.4 million Americans to receive healthcare coverage. Advancements in technology improve both diagnoses and treatment quality. Retail health offers a convenience used by more than 10 million patients at 1,800 retail health locations. Along with the current challenges facing the healthcare system, such as an aging population, increased patient volume and physician shortages, these changes prompt the expansion of the traditional role of a nurse.Generally, Americans believe nurses’ roles are expanding as they share increased responsibilities to support the delivery of high quality healthcare, according to a poll commissioned by University of Phoenix College of Health Professions. The survey also found that adults in the United States view their experience with nurses as overwhelmingly positive. In fact, 95 percent found nurses to be a valuable addition to the healthcare system as a whole, and 87 percent view nurses as trusted sources of health information.“As nurses take on greater responsibility, and as the needs of healthcare organizations continue to grow more complex, the skills and training requirements of nurses must be prepared to match this growth,” says Betty Nelson, Ph.D., RN, and academic dean for University of Phoenix School of Nursing. “This is especially important given that the United States is currently facing a shortage of as many as 90,000 physicians by 2025.. Nurses with advanced education can help fill this shortage, particularly in areas where consumers do not have access to care.”Because of this, employers are looking for nurses with a variety of skills and certifications including:* Additional degrees or seeking an advanced degree* In-demand skills such as bilingualism, leadership and critical thinking* Flexibility and professionalism* The desire to grow into advanced practitioners such as nurse practitioners and physician assistants* Specialized training for working with various populations* An openness to diverse opportunities in a number of different facilitiesIn order to keep up with the changes in the healthcare system, at least 80 percent of the nation’s nursing workforce will need a bachelor’s degree by 2020 and the number of nurses with doctoral degrees will need to be double, according to the Institute of Medicine. Nursing education institutions play a critical role in meeting the needs of today’s healthcare system. Nurses need a place to obtain these degrees and further their skills within the healthcare industry. Institutions recognize the expanding role of the 21st century nurse and are offering a wide range of curriculum and degree programs that address recent changes in the delivery of primary care. Graduates need to be equipped with the skills they need to succeed in today’s health care market.It’s now more important than ever that nurses have the training and skills to match the demands of the growing profession. Along with the nursing community, institutions that offer nursing degree programs must work together to enhance and better prepare the nursing workforce.What employers look for in the 21st century nurse added by new_view_media on November 15, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "(BPT) – What image does the word “grilling” bring to mind? Do you envision thick, juicy burgers or steaks? What about sauce-slathered chicken breasts sizzling over coals? Cooking out is one of the great joys of warm weather, but if you leave side dishes out of your grilling plans – or stick with cold sides like salads – you’re missing out on some great flavors.Side dishes give you a chance to really show off your grilling chops, savor the farm fresh flavors of summer harvests, and indulge in wholesome, organic fare. Here are six summer side dishes that go great on the grill:1. Corn on the cob – If you’ve always wanted to try grilling vegetables but weren’t sure which of your favorites would go well on the grill – take heart! Virtually any veggie can be prepared on a grill, but corn becomes a show-stopper when grilled. Remove the husks and silk and toss the cobs right on a preheated grill. Watch them careful and keep turning them to ensure they brown but don’t burn. The heat from the grill causes the natural sugars in the corn to carmelize, and you’ll end up with the sweetest sweet corn you ever tasted!2. Fries – A trip to the grocery store or farmer’s market for fresh produce may not fit in your schedule if you’re grilling on the fly. There’s good news – frozen options like Alexia Organic Oven Crinkles with Sea Saltdeliver farm to flavor taste when prepared on the grill or in the oven. Made from Pacific Northwest russet potatoes, Alexia’s organic fries are sprinkled with bright sea salt to bring out even more of the rich flavor that Mother Nature delivered. Make a tray out of aluminum foil, spread the Oven Crinkles in a single layer, and grill for about 20-25 minutes at 400-450 degrees F. Turn once or twice during the cooking process.3. Tomatoes – If you’ve only grilled small tomatoes on a kabob, or never tried grilled tomatoes at all, this is your summer to discover grilling tomatoes couldn’t be easier. Start with large, meaty tomatoes – a variety that’s dense and has fewer seeds works best. Slice in half, brush with your favorite seasoned oil and place the halves cut-side down on the grill. Cook for 3-5 minutes on each side. Top with your favorite cheese when done.4. Kale – Grilling greens like kale helps all those wonderful nutrients and flavor stay in the vegetable and don’t disappear into the cooking water – which is what can happen when you boil veggies on the stovetop. Grilling kale couldn’t be easier. You can adapt virtually any of your favorite kale recipes to grilling by tossing the kale with the recipe seasonings and some oil. Arrange the seasoned leaves in a single layer on the grill and they’ll cook to crispy splendor in just minutes.5. Cheese – A slice of gooey melted cheese is the crowning glory atop your grilled burger, but cheese can also handle the grill on its own, and be a delicious, different side dish or appetizer. Many cheeses will work on the grill, and you can find recommendations for the best cheeses to cook on the grill with a simple online search. Slice your chosen cheese in thick pieces. Most grilling cheeses will need minimal seasoning and little or no oil. Generally, cheese takes just a minute or two to brown each side and allow the inside to melt.6. Dinner rolls – Craving dinner rolls to go with that thick juicy steak, but in no mood to fire up the oven when it’s 90 degrees outside? You can make frozen dinner rolls on the grill. Choose your favorite variety, such as Alexia Artisan French Rolls or Artisan Focaccia Rolls, set your gas grill to the temperature recommended on the package’s directions, wrap the rolls in foil and place directly on the grill. Keep an eye on the rolls to ensure they don’t burn as they can cook quickly on a grill.6 summer sides you never knew you could grill added by new_view_media on April 3, 2016View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "(BPT) – Traditional wedding rules have fallen by the wayside – food trucks are in, having a hashtag is a must, bridesmaids no longer wear the same dress and groomsmen are sometimes in sneakers. Couples are actively seeking ways to differentiate themselves and get creative. All that aside, there is one thing that remains constant – weddings must have wine.Without wine, there is no glass to raise during the toast to the bride and groom and nothing to drink when the bar closes during dinner. Wine is the first thing guests are offered when they take a seat, and – you know that they say – it’s important to make a good first impression.Choosing the right varietals for your wedding does not have to be a stressful endeavor. Whether you’re a novice wine drinker or a connoisseur, follow these four tips and you’ll please a crowd without spending a fortune:Say “cheers!” with a sparkling wine.People love a good toast, and nothing washes down a teary maid of honor speech like a glass of sparkling. Riondo Prosecco is an accessible option that’s ideal to enjoy any day of the year, but perfectly suited for special occasions. You’ll get six pours out of a bottle, so plan accordingly!Good things come in threes.In addition to a sparkling, you’ll want a red and a white option that are familiar and food-friendly. You can’t go wrong with a Merlot – look for labels from the Napa region. For a white, Terlato Friuli Pinot Grigio is exceptional and ideal for food pairing.Wine math: What you didn’t learn in school.Running out of wine mid-wedding isn’t an option, so it’s important to do the math. You should anticipate getting about 5 glasses per bottle and assume that each guest will drink one glass per hour. Follow this rule and the wine will flow all night long, keeping you and your guests happy.Don’t break the bank, but stay away from the cheap stuff.Choosing an excellent wine doesn’t mean paying top-dollar, but buying too cheap can mean sacrificing quality. There are countless high-quality, delicious, wines available for $10-$20 per bottle, so leave the cheap stuff on the bottom shelf!4 wine buying tips for weddings added by new_view_media on April 3, 2016View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "(BPT) – Around-the-clock food shows, celebrity guests and niche themed restaurants are just a few reasons the fine food movement continues to experience extraordinary growth. In 2016, more people will be seeking upscale dining experiences that focus on the unique to the luxurious — and they’re willing to pay big bucks to do so.In fact, Americans said they would splurge an average of $203 in order to have a once-in-a-lifetime dining experience at a gourmet restaurant, according to a recent online survey by Harris Poll sponsored byMichelin, the global tire maker that publishes the popular restaurant guide.What’s surprising is the people willing to pay the most for fine dining experiences are younger generations. Millennials (ages 18-34) on average would pay $282 for this culinary experience, compared to diners ages 45-54 who would shell out $170, and $122 for those 65 and older.One explanation for why younger diners are willing to pay so much is that they want to enjoy more than just fine cuisine. Many restaurants offer an overall experience that will be remembered long after the last morsel of food is gone. Whether it’s an incredible atmosphere, the opportunity to observe the chef work or gaining access to foods and cooking styles never available before, this desire for an experience is driving younger diners to invest in upscale dining.As America looks at the most recent Michelin star ratings to navigate the nation’s best eateries, there are some food and restaurant trends that are positioned to grow in 2016. Chefs will continue to expand their creative prowess by experimenting with new cooking styles and food fusions. Cooking methods will blend with science and art to create uniquely fine fare with a story that is as intriguing as the taste.Diversity is another notable trend for 2016. Authentic ethnic cuisine is in high demand and restaurants are answering the call. Traditional restaurants will begin to offer diverse plates in addition to timeless favorites to appeal to a wide range of palates. Expect to see more ancient grains, ethnic spices and worldly condiments at eateries in the future.Conscious dining is a growing trend thanks to diners’ increasing awareness of where their food comes from. Hyper-local sourcing of ingredients is being adopted by many notable restaurants. This includes growing fresh herbs and vegetables onsite and partnering with local farms for incredibly fresh dairy and meat products. Sustainable seafood partnerships are another effort by restaurants that supports the increasing demand for responsible dining options.Finally, diners are seeking chefs with the best reputation for tried-and-true favorites. That means the city’s chef with a reputation for curating and cooking the best steak will have a wait list. Supporting this nod toward the traditional, the Michelin survey found a quarter of U.S. adults say steakhouse cuisine is their favorite choice for dining. What’s the runner up? Italian ranked as the second choice nationally for the meal of a lifetime.Which 2016 dining trend do you want to try most? added by new_view_media on April 3, 2016View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "(BPT) – Snacks, produce, drinks or sweets – if it is a seasonal offering, Americans are anxiously awaiting it. According to Nielsen, Americans spend about $374 billion annually on snack foods. For many of those snack lovers, items that are only available for a limited time are one of the major highlights of seasonal occasions and holidays, especially this time of year when, according to a recent Cheetos brand survey, 65 percent of Americans profess their love of seasonal Easter treats.Whether your favorite holiday arrives in spring, summer, winter or fall, seasonal treats can sweeten your enjoyment of the season. No one wants to miss the coveted special flavors and offerings that appear on store shelves for short stints and are quickly cleared out by that clever “seasonal snack stockpiler” who is always one step ahead of you. So here’s your guide to the top treats to watch for this spring, and throughout the year.SpringIt might still be too chilly to feel like spring in some areas of the country, but St. Patrick’s Day undoubtedly marks the start of the springtime snacking season. Milkshake lovers will kick things off with mint-green milkshakes, and quickly turn their attention to Easter candies and snacks.Chocolate and marshmallow sweets are the traditional stars of Easter baskets across the country – for both the young, and the young at heart. It is no surprise that 71 percent of parents who celebrate Easter admit to sneaking snacks from their kids’ baskets, according to the Cheetos survey.Of course, everyone is familiar with jelly beans, peanut butter eggs, chocolate bunnies and marshmallow chicks, but the majority of consumers say they desire more variety beyond just candy. This year, there’s a new must-try alternative to satisfy the search for something beyond the candy animal monotony. Cheetos Sweetos, the cinnamon-sugar version of everyone’s favorite cheddar cheese snacks is reappearing in stores — and Easter baskets — this spring, but only for a limited time. Launched in 2015, Sweetos snacks are the perfect, and delicious, twist on Easter snacking.SummerFrozen treats are the highlight of summer, but not just the ice cream quarts you find year-round in the freezer cases at your local grocer. Summer means the ice cream truck will be rolling through neighborhood streets, sounding that familiar melodic “come and get it” tune and serving up frozen favorites that you just can’t find anywhere else —  or at any other time of year.You can’t go wrong with the missile-shaped, multi-colored ice pops that beckon from beside a myriad of fruit-flavored cream pops, or reliable favorites like ice cream sandwiches and chocolate-topped cones. And don’t forget snow cones — the refreshing shaved ice in perfect spheres mounted on a paper funnel and topped with your favorite sweet flavoring!FallOf course everyone knows fall is pumpkin season — and you should take every chance to enjoy all things pumpkin-flavored this time of year, from coffee and ice cream to bread, cake and pie.However, autumn also heralds state fair season across the country — and the arrival of a variety of innovative sweet treats that can only be enjoyed among the unique surroundings of fair rides, tickets and games. Funnel cakes are a state fair staple, and what could be better when the weather gets nippy than enjoying lightly sweetened, deep-fried dough dusted heavily with confectioner’s sugar? Depending on where you live in the country and which fair you attend, you can find over-the-top sweets and snacks such as deep-fried ice cream, fried candy bars and even pretzel-encrusted brownies deep-fried on a stick.WinterOf course, winter holidays are the pinnacle of seasonal snacking. From the final weeks of pumpkin season to the eggnog, candy canes and baked goods associated with holiday moments from Thanksgiving through New Year’s, winter serves up a buffet of food and snacks that are available at no other time of year.Winter’s arrival means anticipated delicacies like gingerbread-flavored everything, bite-sized candy favorites that marry mint and chocolate in holiday shapes, and of course the much-maligned and equally beloved fruit cake all hit store shelves just in time to make the holiday party circuit!Whatever your preference — savory, salty or sweet — make sure to enjoy these snacking staples throughout the year. But remember that seasonal treats come and go quickly, so be ready to grab a bag of Sweetos snacks, remember to listen for the ice cream truck’s playful tune, try your state’s delicacies and fill stockings with enough gingerbread cookies or mint-themed chocolate drops to last through the end of the year!Don’t miss these must-have snacks that define each season of the year added by new_view_media on April 3, 2016View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Be Well Tressed Every Day With Wigs(NAPSI)—Changing your hair to suit your hat, your mood or your outfit-or to make holidays and other celebrations that much more special—can be easier and more fun than ever.TV Star’s IdeaExplains Daytime Emmy Award winner Sherri Shepherd, “When I was a little girl, I would hear all this commotion in my house from my mom, aunts and grandmother when picking out their wigs for the day. It was such a good time for them and was a major part of their everyday beauty routines. Ever since then, I’ve watched the women in my household glow with confidence because they would customize their look day by day through the use of faux hair. My grandmother had a wig that she would pick out and wear perfectly with specific hats. My mother had an Angela Davis ‘power to the people’ wig. Watching these iconic women in my life pair their hair lengths, styles and colors with particular hats, outfits and personalities was exciting. Getting ready to go out was like an event in and of itself. Wigs are the perfect way for the inner diva in all women to come out and get creative, which is why I was inspired to start my own wig line to give women the choices to create their own style and look.“I always say, you were born with the hair you’ve got—now get the hair you want. Short and sassy, long and sexy or curly and fierce; you can easily change your hairstyle and transform your whole look to fit whatever your day brings. This is one of the reasons I wanted to create my line of wigs for Luxhair—I wanted to be able to give busy women high-quality, versatile looks to choose from that were simple and quick to put on but that were affordable and wouldn’t break their budget too.”The result is the Luxhair Now by Sherri Shepherd high-fashion wig and extension collection. “The collection provides the look you want, the style you want and the perfect accent to make a personal style statement, now.”Why WigsLike putting on your most stylish shoes and more powerful than a red lipstick, Shepherd says, these high-fashion styles can add some fabulous to your everyday. They can also be an excellent accessory to have during the holiday season when you want a party perfect ‘do but don’t want to spend a lot of time getting it. With a variety of lace front styles that give the appearance of natural hair growth, allow for styling away from the face and heat-friendly fiber, these wigs stand up to heat and humidity, offer styling options, and look, feel and move like real hair.What’s NewNow that Luxhair Now by Sherri Shepherd has partnered with national retailer Sally Beauty Supply, two new fun wig styles are available in over 1,900 stores nationwide.• Textured Pixie is a sassy pixie wig that features choppy texture for maximum volume and style along with precision-cut bangs that frame the face.

      "On National Senior Citizens Day, Three Ways To Celebrate The Older Generation(NAPSI)—Whether it’s your parents, grandparents, aunt, uncle or neighbor, you likely received guidance from or looked to older people in your life as you’ve tried to become more independent and deal with change and everyday challenges. August 21 is National Senior Citizens Day, and it’s an ideal time to honor seniors for the wisdom and care they have provided us, and also to celebrate the members of the older generation by finding ways to enhance their lives as they age.There’s No Place Like HomeNearly 90 percent of seniors want to age in place—stay in their own homes as they get older. But one out of three seniors suffers a fall each year, according to the CDC. Making an older person’s home as safe as possible is integral to helping him or her maintain this independence. Walking through seniors’ daily routine with them, from the time they get out of bed to when they go back to sleep, can reveal patterns in how they navigate their home and any potential hazards. By identifying the areas of concern and making necessary adjustments, you can decrease the risk of an accident and seniors can reside more confidently in their own home.Stay ConnectedTechnology now allows grandparents to FaceTime their children and grandchildren across the globe or even in the next town, and seniors to reconnect with classmates of decades past via Facebook. Older generations can create, build and maintain quality social relationships with the convenience and ease of social media. Seniors have a multitude of online outlets to share updates, photos and videos with loved ones. To help them stay in touch, ensure that the seniors in your life have reliable Internet connectivity, and help them set up social media accounts if they don’t have one already. In-person interaction is ideal, but keeping in touch through computers, tablets and smartphones is a great way to supplement seeing and speaking with each other.Everyone’s Wearing TechnologyWearable technology like the Apple Watch is popular among younger audiences, but wearable fitness trackers and medical alert devices can provide great benefits to seniors as well. In the event of a fall or accident where it’s impossible to get to a phone to call for help, a medical alert device immediately connects the injured to emergency services. Because that person’s medical history and health needs are on file, first responders can more easily treat them. With help a push of a button away, medical alert devices give seniors peace of mind even beyond health concerns. In fact, a recent survey by Bay Alarm Medical found that 80 percent of medical alert device wearers worry less when their adult children travel because they feel the device provides an adequate support system. If you decide to help protect the senior in your life with a wearable medical alert system, it’s also wise to look for a caring, people-first, ethical provider. Bay Alarm Medical, for example, implemented a Code of Ethics it follows for uncompromisingly ethical and transparent business practices. The company vows to prioritize customers over sales, make pricing publicly accessible and never pressure customers into a product or service they do not need, among other safeguards.National Senior Citizens Day is a day to commemorate the great ways in which seniors have helped us and we should show them how thankful we are every day. Simple steps such as a home safety walk-through, staying connected and providing the tools to enhance their physical and emotional well-being can go a long way in reducing the stress of aging for seniors and their loved ones.On National Senior Citizens Day, Three Ways To Celebrate The Older Generation added by new_view_media on December 24, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Don’t Let The Flu Mean Missing Memorable Moments(NAPSI)—While the cold and flu season often coincides with holiday celebrations and family get-togethers, there are preventative measures that families can take to stay healthy and not miss out.To help you get to the next “can’t miss” life event, consider these top preventative tips:• Get an annual flu shot. It’s the most effective way to help prevent the spread of influenza. For your convenience, you can get a vaccine at any of the more than 7,800 CVS/pharmacy and 900 MinuteClinic locations across the country. The flu shot is available every day with no appointment needed, including evenings and weekends.As a preventive service under the Affordable Care Act, it’s fully covered and available at no cost through most insurance plans, including Medicare Part B.The pharmacy can also be a one-stop shop for flu prevention resources, including over-the-counter cold and flu remedies, multivitamins and anti-bacterial cleaning products. Plus, anyone enrolled in the ExtraCare Rewards program gets a 20 percent off CVS Shopping Pass upon getting the flu shot in most places.• Seniors, take extra precaution. There’s a high-dose flu shot designed for those 65 and older, who have a greater risk of severe illness from the flu.• Plan ahead: the earlier, the better. It takes up to two weeks for your immunity to build up after getting a flu shot. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone who is at least 6 months old get a flu shot as soon as the vaccine is available.• Stay home if you’re ill. While it may seem like a no-brainer, two-thirds of employed Americans would still go to work even if they were feeling ill with flu-like symptoms. It’s important to understand the preliminary symptoms of the flu and, if you experience them, to stay home. This will help bolster your immune system and prevent the germs spreading.• Practice healthy habits. Door handles, desks and other everyday items are ridden with germs. Wash your hands frequently with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds and avoid touching your mouth and eyes. Additionally, eat nutritious foods, drink plenty of water, and get sufficient sleep to keep your immune system in top shape. Lead by example to educate children about these habits.Learn MoreFor further information and to find a nearby store, visit www.cvs.com/flu or download the CVS/pharmacy mobile app.Don’t Let The Flu Mean Missing Memorable Moments added by new_view_media on December 24, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Medicare Open Enrollment: What You Need To Knowby Patricia Smith(NAPSI)—Every year, millions of Medicare beneficiaries must decide which Medicare Advantage (MA) plan will best serve their needs. During Medicare’s annual open enrollment period, October 15-December 7, you can change MA plans or enroll in one for the first time. Important factors to consider include premium costs, choice of doctors and plan benefits. But there is one other important question: What is the quality rating of the plan?Quality is important because it means better health care and the best value for your money. Medicare uses a system called Star Ratings to assess the quality of plans, awarding plans from one to five stars. These ratings are based on many factors, such as how well the plan does in keeping people healthy and preventing illness, how quickly you can get an appointment and see specialists, and how the plan responds to your complaints and concerns.Today, 65 percent of MA enrollees are in plans with four stars or more, compared to 17 percent in 2009. Eight of the 12 MA plans earning five stars this year are members of the Alliance of Community Health Plans, an organization representing high-quality health plans.You can learn more about MA plans using the Medicare Plan Finder at www.Medicare.gov. The National Committee for Quality Assurance also evaluates quality in MA plans at www.ncqa.org.• Ms. Smith is the president and CEO of the Alliance of Community Health Plans, www.achp.org.Medicare Open Enrollment: What You Need To Know added by new_view_media on December 24, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Triple Sorghum Granola(Family Features) As you look to the new year with plans for healthier habits, there’s no better place to start than the beginning – the beginning of each day, that is. Countless studies have shown the benefits of a nutritious breakfast as part of a healthy eating plan, and there are plenty of options to make a good-for-you breakfast that tastes great, too.Experts agree that there are numerous health benefits to breakfast. For example, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics credits breakfast with helping brain function and memory as well as preventing tiredness and overeating as the day wears on. Mayo Clinic staff adds that adults who eat breakfast are likely to consume more vitamins and minerals, and less fats and cholesterol.Wake up your morning routine with these tips for a healthier start to each day:Plan a well-rounded meal. Incorporate whole grains, like sorghum, lean protein, low-fat dairy and fruits and vegetables, for a nutrient-rich meal that will keep you fueled and feeling full until lunch time.Experiment with new flavors. Avoid burnout and boredom by trying new foods. For example, substitute your typical grain with sorghum, an American-grown cereal grain.

      " The Morris County Board of Freeholders invites the public to join them in observing the 14th anniversary of 9/11 at a Remembrance Service and Candlelight Vigil on Sun., Sept. 13.The ceremony will begin at 5 p.m. at the Morris County September 11th Memorial on West Hanover Avenue in Parsippany-Troy Hills, across from the Morris View Healthcare Center and adjacent to the Morris County Public Safety Academy.The event will include a march with a color guard up West Hanover Avenue to the Memorial by police, fire, rescue and emergency personnel from across Morris County.The observance will include a special invocation, a lighting of candles, and reading of the names of each of the Morris County victims, plus a 21-gun salute, and keynote remarks.Elizabeth Schrier, the widow of the late Freeholder Jack Schrier, who was instrumental in getting Morris County’s 9/11 Memorial constructed, will carry the American flag during the ceremony.Morris County’s September 11th Memorial pays tribute to all of those who died in the terrorist attacks in New York, Pennsylvania and Washington D.C., on Sept. 11, 2001, with a special emphasis on the 64 victims from Morris County whose names are etched in plaques that are affixed to the Memorial.The names of all of the nearly 3,000 people who died that day are engraved in ruby-colored paving stones that have been set in the ground as a walkway surrounding the Memorial.“It is vitally important to gather each year on the anniversary of 9/11 to recall every single one of the nearly 3,000 people who were tragically lost to us on that day, including 64 of our Morris County residents,’’ said Freeholder Director Kathy DeFillippo. “Their families and friends should know that the lives of their loved ones will never be forgotten.’’Since seating at the Memorial is limited, the public is encouraged to bring lawn chairs to the outdoor observance. Parking will be available at the Morris County Department of Human Services building at 340 West Hanover Ave., in Morris Township – across from the Academy. Shuttle buses will be available to transport those in need to the Memorial.The freeholders also invite police and fire departments and rescue squads from across the county to participate by sending one apparatus per department and assembling at 6 p.m. at the Morris County Public Safety Academy, 500 West Hanover Ave., in Parsippany-Troy Hills. From there, a procession will be held to the Sept. 11th Memorial.More information can be obtained by calling 973-285-6400, 973-829-8120 or 973-829-8200.          Morris County To Hold Memorial Service 5 p.m. added by new_view_media on September 1, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Morris Arts recently opened a 15th exhibit, entitled Black, White and Green at the Gallery in Morristown.  Guest curator Katherine Murdock, the Exhibition Committee of Morris Arts and the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation selected works by several outstanding artists in New Jersey and New York.\n",
      "Inspired by the biowall, the vertical garden of living plants within the exhibit space, Murdock chose to focus the exhibit on plants and selected the title, Black, White and Green, to purposefully reflect that limited color palette as a means of unifying the exhibit. What is striking, however, is the richness and variety of the artists’ unique approaches to the theme – through their use of different media (collage, oil, cold wax painting, photography, charcoal drawings, wood sculpture, etc.), composition, and subtle gradations of color.As Murdock notes, “Casey Ruble’s paper collage illustrates a bundled bouquet of invasive plant species and Kathy Cantwell’s oil and cold wax on panel explores green color fields that resemble landscape. Richard Bottwin uses plant material as a medium and highlights the wood grain with stain and paint.”The public is invited to view this exciting exhibit, open Mon.-Fri. from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and by appointment, and will remain on display until Aug. 24.  Visit www.morrisarts.org<https://www.morrisarts.org or call 973- 285-5115 for additional information.Morris Arts located in Morristown is a not-for-profit organization founded in 1973 dedicated to building community through the artsBlack, White, Green Art Exhibit Featured In Gallery added by new_view_media on March 19, 2016View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Locals Volunteer To Build A Better Life In GuatemalaBy Cheryl ConwayBeyond the conditions many can relate to, outside the walls of what’s the norm, exists a world so difficult to imagine unless one visits and reaches out to help.In Guatemala City, 11,000 people- in which 7,000 are kids- live and work inside a garbage dump.“Most survive by picking through the trash to earn less than five dollars a day. Many find their daily food in the dump.”Just when all hopelessness is lost for these human beings living in one of the most impoverished areas , more and more volunteers are stepping up to assist and steer them to a better life. Some local people have become very involved and formed an organization known as Beyond The Walls. This month, 75 individuals are volunteering to visit the Guatemala City Garbage Dump to build houses, donate clothing and shoes and organize sport clinics.The non-profit organization started in 2007 at the Mendham Hills Community Church, although mission teams were sent out before.“We had been going to Guatemala for a couple of years,” explains Betsy Ahl of Morris Township, executive director of Beyond The Walls. “The church was sending mission teams. We asked volunteers to help raise money to help pay for trips, build houses. They’d raise more money and that would go toward projects.”In order to influence others outside the church to get involved, and to receive matching grants from volunteers’ employers, organizers decided to expand the church group to a secular, non-profit organization, explains Ahl.The idea to help the people of Guatemala dates back to 2005, when Mendham was named one of the top wealthiest places to live in America.“The elders of Mendham Hills Chapel thought this wasn’t how others lived,” explains Ahl, “so they asked the chairman of the missions’ team to find an area that needed help.”One of the poorest places in the world, the Guatemala City Garbage Dump, was identified by a church member and the idea to team up with the Potter’s House organization, with a mission to eradicate poverty, build houses, help others get business loans and establish community programs.“It’s a ravine right in the center of the Capitol City,” describes Ahl. “They’ve been filling it up with garbage for 50 years.”In their first mission, Ahl joined 26 others for four days. The group, after that, “could have gone to Africa one year, China one year,” but the group decided it was more important to “come back and form long term relationships,” says Ahl who has sponsored three kids in Guatemala in the Kids In Potter House Education Program, in which 50 kids are sponsored to receive an education. Ahl has been sponsoring these kids since they were in the first grade, are now graduating high school and will be supported through college.Church member and organization volunteer, Mike Rubright, 50, of Long Valley, is currently on one of three missions to Guatemala this month through Beyond The Walls. His ninth trip out there during the past seven years, Rubright and his daughter, Erin, are working in the garbage dump from July 18-25.Another one of his daughters, Emily, has gone on the trip seven times but had to miss this one. Youth volunteers must be starting atleast seventh grade to participate, so for Erin this is her third trip. Volunteers must contribute $1,600 each in order to participate, with funds going toward flight and lodging; and additional funds to supplies and building houses. Every year, Rubright sends letters and emails to friends requesting donations to help support his volunteer work.About 75 people have signed up through Beyond The Walls to volunteer during the three missions this month, with 10 people from the Mendham, Long Valley and Chester areas. The others are from areas throughout the country such as Florida, New York and Texas, who formed their own groups with Beyond The Walls.Rubright and his wife, Katie, have a niece who was adopted from Guatemala so their connection is even greater.“I do construction all day long,” says Rubright. “I had no idea what I was doing; I had no construction experience. Now I’m the person in charge of construction projects my week.“Everybody builds, everybody works; it doesn’t matter how old you are,” says Rubright, principal at the Woodglen Middle School in Lebanon Twp.“We build a concrete block house with a concrete floor,” he explains. “We mix concrete by hand; it’s the hardest thing I’ve ever done. The girls and women work harder than I’ve ever seen; they don’t stop.” A family that is getting a house built works beside the volunteers.“It’s not very big,” he says, with the homes about 15 feet by 15 feet,” the size of a bedroom. Homes are for four to five person families, and sometimes six to eight people.It’s like “nine people living in the size of your kitchen,” describes Ahl. Homes are built side by side and cost $5,600 to build.A completed house consists of one big room with one eight-foot partition wall that separates the bedrooms from “everything else,” says Rubright. “They have a toilet and a shower stall” in an area about the size of a closet, and they get “a big concrete sink” that can weigh up to 600 pounds, which is used for all washing needs such as dishes and clothes.Rubright also works under Guatemala masons who are very particular with how they want things to be completed, he says.“They tell us what to do,” says Rubright. “There are a lot of times we do things that don’t make sense; you can’t tell them they are wrong. That’s frustrating. If they tell you to put a hole in a concrete pipe with a hammer and nails, instead of a drill, you do it.”The homes that are being built for the people in the Guatemala City Garbage Dump is luxury compared to the “cardboard sheet metal,” dirt, chemicals, methane gas that surround them and sicken them while living in the dump and “breathing the trash.”These houses also provide shelter and protection for these people, says Rubright, as gun shots are commonly fired in the garbage dump.His goal during this one week visit is to build three to five houses with his group of volunteers.Potter’s House has built 110 homes to date, with 75 contributed by the volunteers of Beyond The Walls, says Ahl, who visits four times, about six weeks a year.In addition to building homes, the volunteers lead soccer clinics and donate uniforms, soccer balls and cleats as well as baseball clinics and donations of t-shirts; help at a medical clinic, vacation Bible school, and deliver groceries and visit families.Through their efforts, much progress has been made such as concrete roads, a community center built last year, education programs which is much needed as the average kid does not go past fifth grade in Guatemala, says Rubright.“A lot of families look at education as not important,” says Rubright. “A lot end up working in the garbage dump” as scavengers. “They make money picking out recyclables. People sift through trash looking through recyclables to see what they can sell” or “they are looking for food to eat it.” Parents stop sending their kids to school because they need their school age kids to watch younger siblings so parents can work.If they are not scavengers, they rely on the garbage dump to sell their own goods, like tortillas to the scavengers so they can eat, and even jewelry, says Ahl.“It’s just this culture of poverty,” says Ahl, with high unemployment. “Education is not a value, that’s the bottom line. Potter’s House tries to teach the value of education especially to the parents.” It also tries to teach the vendors who do sell inside the garbage dump to sell on the outside, says Ahl.“But without education, it’s really, really hard to move their way out of the dump,” says Ahl.Scavengers are even making less these days. As the economy declined, so did the value of recyclables, explains Rubright. For those working 10 to 12 hour days, they are making two to three dollars.While “there are guns everywhere, “Rubright admits that he feels safe when there.“The organization we are with is well respected,” he says, and they stay in a retreat center with accommodations like that of a motel or college dorm. “We are safe; every store has an armed guard,” and no one walks alone. “We have relationships with people. We go to the same neighborhoods. There’s more of a comfort level now. It’s a safe place- I bring my kids there I’m not in fear of our lives.”It is the desire to help others and the appreciation that brings Rubright back to the dump.He says, “If there’s really a God, why does he let that happen? We let it happen by not choosing to use our resources that way. I don’t think I could not go back. They have so little but they appreciate everything they have. We have so much and we want so much more.”They say, “This morning I lived in a garbage dump; now I live in a mansion.”Rubright admits, “I’ve learned more from them than they get from me. I’m a better person in Guatemala than I am here.”Also nice is the community bond shared by the volunteers.For the last five or six years, the same group of people have been volunteering. “Everyone enjoys each other’s company,” say Rubright. “We work hard all day, you come back eat dinner. There’s community; there’s no television, little internet, no cell services. It’s a lot what life should be like.”Like Ahl, the Rubrights have sponsored a girl there since she was eight; now she is 17. Through their support they have helped Jennifer Lopez Munoz continue to go to school and get an education.Rubright tells people, “I have three daughters in America and one in Guatemala.”“All the kids down there, they know when we come back,” says Rubright. “It’s humbling; it’s like family.” Volunteers bring with them bags of clothing and shoes for more than 200 kids.Beyond the Walls has helped other communities outside of Guatemala, such as Native Americans, homeless people in Dover and in Newark.Rubright plans to volunteer at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota next, which is known as the poorest place in the U.S., next to Haiti, from alcoholism and unemployment faced by Native Americans. “This was their country and they are at the bottom of the ladder.”Beyond the Walls is always seeking more volunteers, contributions for clothing and shoes, and financial support.Its next mission to the garbage dump is Oct. 24-31, with already 20 people signed up.Go to Beyondthewalls.org for more information. To volunteer, email gobeyomdthewalls@gmail.com.“I encourage people to go, go somewhere,” says Rubright, Long Valley softball coach for the past 14 years and former school board member. “Find something to do where you can do something for someone else. There are people everywhere who need something. You do not need to be religious. Some people think it’s a church thing – it’s people helping other people.”Locals Volunteer To Build A Better Life In Guatemala added by new_view_media on August 18, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "St. Virgil Group Helps Keep Morris Plains Cleaner And Litter FreeAs the weather gets warmer, groups will be spreading out across Morris Plains to pick up litter and recyclables that have been carelessly tossed along roadways and in parks. The first to participate this year were a group of twelve students from St. Virgil.\n",
      "The St. Virgil group uses their mini grant money to help fund their yearly trip to Appalachia to help do work in this very depressed area. Along with two adults the young people were out on a chilly and drizzly first weekend in April to scour Simones Park. They picked up seven large bags of trash and two large bags of recyclables.\n",
      "Simones Park, at the end of Mountain Way, has been adopted by the sixth grade students from Borough School that have pledged to go out and clean the park four times a year. But Simones Park is a problem area. Even with the Borough School group, extra clean-ups, like this one by St. Virgil, and the help of neighbors that live across the street, litter is a consistent problem. Banners in the park with the litter program logo “Pick Up Morris Plains – Keep Us Litter Free” as a reminder to visitors have helped, but not enough.\n",
      "Litter is unhealthy, unsightly, and can be a safety hazard. Simones Park not only has soccer fields and open areas, but also has a well-used playground, so that broken bottles and crushed cans could lead to injuries.\n",
      "Anyone can help stop litter by using the many recycling containers and trash cans placed throughout the parks, as well as all along the main street, Speedwell Avenue. There is also a recycling container placed across the street from the train station. But even more important, the attitude that causes people to litter must be changed. People tend to think that somebody else will clean up litter left in the street or on the sidewalk, especially in places where there already is a lot of litter or places where the sense of community pride is low.\n",
      "Morris Plains wants everyone to take responsibility for their actions and pride in the environment and the town – don’t litter, put trash and recyclables in their proper place!\n",
      "Morris Plains Councilman John “Jack” Doherty is the liaison to the Clean Communities and Recycling programs and he commended the mini grant groups saying, “We are pleased that so many groups come out during the year to help with litter pickups, but hope our residents will keep our town a “community of caring” and do their part.”\n",
      "The groups that participate receive grant funds from the State Clean Communities Program. Penny Manser is head of the Youth Ministry at St. Virgil and said that, “The mission trip we take each summer is ten days of working with the people of Harlan, Kentucky, the 18th poorest county in the United States. The families there are picked by lottery for help with roofing, plumbing, painting, ditch digging, sheet rock work, siding, clean up from floods or whatever is needed by these local families. It is our opportunity to truly work as disciples in the world, and to learn to be grateful for the gifts that we have.”\n",
      "For more information about the Morris Plains Clean Communities program residents can go to the Borough of Morris Plains Web Site at https://www.morrisplainsboro.org/ and can sign up for the Mini-Grant program by contacting the Municipal Clean Communities Coordinator, Ellie Falco at (973) 538-9103.St. Virgil Group Helps Keep Morris Plains Cleaner And Litter Free  added by new_view_media on May 1, 2016View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "On Sun., Sept. 13 Macculloch Hall Historical Museum welcomes Linda J. Barth from the Canal Society of New Jersey (CSNJ) Barth will present a program about The Delaware and Raritan Canal (D&R). The D&R is one of the subjects of the current second floor gallery exhibit “Canals of New Jersey” which will be available to view prior to the presentation.Canal author and historian Linda J. Barth will introduce the people, the bridges, the locks, and the aqueducts that made D&R Canal work. This waterway, now a “greenway” and the centerpiece of a popular state park, transported men and supplies between New York and Philadelphia during three wars. Inventor John Holland used the canal to deliver his Holland VI submarine to Washington for its Navy trials, and luxury yachts, like J .P. Morgan’s Tarantula, cruised the waterway.For more than 170 years, the D&R Canal has meandered across the narrow waist of New Jersey and was one of the nation’s most successful towpath canals, carrying more tonnage in 1866 than the more famous Erie Canal. Johnson & Johnson, Roebling, and Fleischmann’s Distillery all had their start along the D&R. These days the canal provides the people of central New Jersey with both a water supply and a premier recreational facility. Today, the Morris Canal Greenway, a partnership between local communities and the Canal Society of New Jersey, seeks to preserve the surviving historic remains of the canal, interpret canal sites, and offer recreational opportunities to the public. In this presentation Linda will discuss the history and operation of the canal and how it is used today.MHHM opens at 1 p.m. on Sept. 13 and visitors who arrive prior to the 4:30 p.m. program can enjoy the “Canals of New Jersey” exhibit. MHHM has partnered with CSNJ to present this display of panels that tell the story of New Jersey’s two towpath canals, the Morris and the Delaware and Raritan. The CSNJ’s display is supplemented by objects including some from MHHM’s collection and information about Macculloch Hall founder George Macculloch who had the idea for the Morris Canal. The exhibit shares some of the stories of the workers and families who lived and worked on the canal, as well as other details about its construction using photographs and drawings, as well objects such as model canal boats.Tickets for the program go on sale from 1 p.m., no advance sales, and remain on sale until the presentation begins at 4:30 p.m. Speaker tickets include admission to the museum exhibits during the afternoon and a guided tour of period rooms, the last tour ticket is sold at 3 p.m. Speaker tickets will remain on sale until 4:30 p.m.The Museum’s second floor “The Civil War Through the Eyes of Thomas Nast” and “Canals of New Jersey” exhibits will remain on view until 4:30 p.m. The first floor “Thomas Nast: Unknown Works and American Icons” exhibit will close 3:30 p.m. – 4 p.m. in preparation for the program. Tickets to hear speakers are Adults $8; Seniors & Students $6; Children 6 – 12 $4. Members and children under 5 are admitted free.For more information call Karen Hollywood, Publicity and Programs Coordinator Macculloch Hall Historical Museum at (973) 538-2404 ext. 15.Linda Barth To Speak At MHHM added by new_view_media on August 16, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "An Evening with The Monkees\n",
      "Featuring Micky Dolenz and Peter TorkThursday, August 27 at 8 pm(Morristown) – Hey, hey it’s The Monkees, featuring Micky Dolenz and Peter Tork, coming to Mayo Performing Arts Center on Thursday, August 27, 2015 at 8 pm. Tickets are $49-99.When four young men were cast in the television roles of a struggling rock band inspired by The Beatles’ A Hard Day’s Night, few could have predicted the impact The Monkees would make on music and pop culture at large, an impact that still reverberates 50 years later.Assembled in Los Angeles in 1965 by Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider for the television series The Monkees, the quartet of Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith, Peter Tork, and the late Davy Jones brought a singular mix of pop, rock, psychedelica, Broadway, and country to their music. The show itself, meanwhile, paid tribute not only to The Beatles, but also to the comedy stylings of The Marx Brothers and Laurel and Hardy as well as the pop-art sensibilities of Warhol and the emerging San Francisco psychedelic scene.The Monkees’ first single, “Last Train to Clarksville,” was released in August 1966, hitting #1 and serving as advance publicity for their series, which debuted on September 12. When the group’s self-titled debut album arrived in stores a month later, it quickly headed for the top spot of the Billboard charts, where it would ultimately sit for 13 of the 78 weeks it remained in the Top 200. (Two decades later, in the midst of a new burst of Monkee-mania, The Monkees popped back onto the charts, bringing the total number of weeks to 102.)By the time the group’s TV series aired its final new episode on March 25, 1968, the Monkees had seen three further albums top the charts – More of the Monkees, Headquarters, and Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones, Ltd., all of which were released in 1967, staggeringly enough – while racking up several more hit singles, with “I’m a Believer,” “(I’m Not Your) Steppin’ Stone,” “A Little Bit Me, A Little Bit You,” “The Girl I Knew Somewhere,” “Pleasant Valley Sunday,” “Words,”  “Daydream Believer,” “Valleri,” and “Tapioca Tundra” all finding their way into the Billboard Top 40.After the series’ two-season run, the group went on to star in the cult feature film HEAD (co-written by Jack Nicholson) and a TV special (33 1/3 Revolutions per Monkee) while also continuing to record new material, but much as the ’60s gave way to the ’70s, the members of the Monkees eventually gave in to their individual musical interests and went their separate ways. for awhile.In February 1986, after MTV broadcast a marathon of The Monkees, Dolenz, Jones, and Tork reunited for a 20th anniversary tour, with Nesmith joining them onstage for the Los Angeles date of the tour, and in 1996, all four members of the group reunited for a new album (Justus) and TV special (Hey, Hey, It’s the Monkees).In the wake of Jones’s death on February 29, 2012, the surviving members of the Monkees reunited and performed a series of concerts. The shows were greeted with sell-out response and phenomenal reviews. Now, Micky Dolenz and Peter Tork carry on that tradition with a full evening of magic music and multi-media splendor, including clips from their Emmy Award winning series. Their new show features all of the Monkees hits, plus an intimate acoustic set and solo spots for each of the singers. An Evening With The Monkees is sure to please every fan of the band.Mayo Performing Arts Center, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, presents a wide range of programs that entertain, enrich, and educate the diverse population of the region and enhance the economic vitality of Northern New Jersey.

      "by Elsie Walker Halloween will soon be here.  Many times on Halloween, or around camp fires, stories of ghosts; strange, creepy or haunted places; and recollections of strange occurrences are shared.  Some people pass stories on from generation to generation until they become legend. However, others, like members of the New Jersey Ghost Hunters Society (NJGHS), investigate strange occurrences to see if there is a paranormal presence involved.  Recently, people from around the coverage area shared stories and sightings of local ghosts, rumors of haunted locations, and experiences with the paranormal. Members of the online, “You Know You’re From Roxbury Township….” group recalled ghost tales and scary sights.  One popular ghost story was the Hooker Man. It is about a ghost seen by the Succasunna railroad tracks. “The Hooker Man lost his hand in some freak train accident, and now searches for it with a lantern,” shared Mike Stark, Roxbury.   However, it appears the Hooker Man has not only been seen in Roxbury, but Netcong, Flanders, Chester, and Long Valley also lay claim to the legend. Cheryl McClung, a former area resident, who now lives in Georgia, shared, “At night, people see his [the Hooker Man’s] lantern bouncing along the tracks in Flanders on the west side of [Route} 206. Dawn Traetta Hair, of Florida, another former Roxbury resident, remembers the stories of the former location of the Church of the Mystic Light in Flanders.  The building is closed, but there had been claims that witches had hung chickens and have had seances there. People still stop by it, out of curiosity, if not scared away.Kim Howell Candore shared that there have been ghost sightings at her childhood home, “I was raised at 11 Meeker Street [in] Succasunna, next to the cemetery. There has been many spottings of two men in Civil War uniforms smoking, sitting on a tree stump in front of our old house,”   said Candore, who now lives in Tennessee. Candore remembers that the two churches on Main Street, adjacent to the cemetery, used to be a military hospital. Also shared, was that Roxbury has its very own “haunted house” in the form of the Halloween House, a tremendous display put on by the Heard family in Roxbury.Hackettstown is the meeting site of the NJ Ghost Hunters Society.  The society’s mission statement is “To search out definitive proof of life beyond the grave.  To provide paranormal investigations to those who request them, free of charge. To train those individuals, who so desire and become members of the NJGHS, in the protocols of professional, ethical and scientific paranormal investigating..” L’aura  Hladik Hoffman is the society’s founder and director. She is the author of Ghosthunting New Jersey, Ghosthunting New York City, and Ghosts of the Poconos and has a variety of presentations on the paranormal which will be given at area libraries this month  (listed on the bottom of www.njghs.net/presentations.html). Recently, Hoffman recalled stories she was told of two ghosts who are said to haunt Bea McNally’s (formerly Charlie Brown Restaurant).  In 1878, the place was the Clarendon House (hotel) and from 1926-1947 it was the Hackettstown Inn.  “The ghost girl appeared to a young girl who was living at the hotel when her family owned it. She snuck down to the kitchen in the middle of the night for some ice cream. When she was headed out of the kitchen and into the dining room to sneak back upstairs, she was met with this bright, sparkling light and out of the light stepped a young girl – about the same age of the girl sneaking the ice cream – and the ghost girl was dressed from a different time period and clutching her teddy bear. The ice cream girl screamed, dropped the ice cream and ran up to her room. The next day when her parents confronted her about the mess in the dining room, they did not believe her about the ghost girl she saw. However, a couple weeks later, the father saw the ghost girl, too.”As for the other ghost, Hoffman said there are various origin stories as to who he is. Most have to do with drowning. Two versions have him as a child who was staying upstairs and died while unattended in the bathtub.  Hoffman shared that in another version of the story, “A Lady of the Evening was distraught over unrequited love of one of her clients and she took a bath and drank a bottle of gin and passed out and drowned.” However, most seem to think the ghost is a child as they have got the sensation of someone wanting to ride on their shoulders or putting a small hand into theirs.Over the years there have been other stories of ghostly presence at the location, such as unexplained footsteps and, when there was a pool hall at the location, how when it was unlocked for business one day,  instead of the cleaned pool hall, cues, etc. were strung all over. In Pompton Lakes, Laura Jennings, a member of the historic commission there, shared about some caring spirits at the Schuyler Colfax house ( Hamburg turnpike, Wayne)  “Dr. Jane Colfax Young grew up in the house with her father (Dr. Richard S. Colfax) and Aunt (also Dr. Jane Colfax). Katherine Young, daughter to Jane Colfax Young, shared that she spent a lot of time in the home until he was ten years old. Both her and her father felt and saw things in the house that they are sure were the spirits of their ancestors watching over them. The Colfax family is one of the founding families in the area.”Jennings also shared that she had heard reports of ghost sightings at the Lenox School in Pompton Plains.Morristown has had its own dealing with the paranormal.  Pat Goodfriend, Membership & Volunteer Coordinator for the Morris County Historical Society shared a short 2016 article by Y. McGreevy on Ford Mansion. The mansion at the Morristown National Historical Park is over 200 years old.  Once the home of George Washington (briefly during 1780), the mansion drew the interest of Gordon Thomas Ward, a paranormal investigator, who in 2016, did a presentation on the Mansion and his two-year study of it, including the noises said to be coming from inside its walls.  An article by B. LaMuraglia the same year shows that during the time of his investigation, Ward heard the voices of three male and two female spirits.  None were Washington; Ward felt at least one could have been a kitchen servant. Bells Mansion, near the Netcong-Stanhope border has also been the subject of a paranormal study.  That was shared by Tom Lupo of Hopatcong, a producer who followed the NJ Ghost Hunters Society when it investigated the restaurant six years ago.  The segment includes a worker recalling seeing the spirit of a woman. He was cleaning up after the restaurant had closed. There are windows between the rooms.  He looked up and saw a woman, seated in the next room, looking out at the road. He watched her for about 10 seconds and then went to approach her. When he walked into that room, she was gone. This Halloween, will the Hooker Man or the little girl ghost at Bea McNally’s be seen?  Will voices whisper through Ford Mansion or the Lenox School? Perhaps, this year, a new spirit will be seen and its legend begun. Hauntings Around the Area for Halloween added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Locals Volunteer To Build A Better Life In GuatemalaBy Cheryl ConwayBeyond the conditions many can relate to, outside the walls of what’s the norm, exists a world so difficult to imagine unless one visits and reaches out to help.In Guatemala City, 11,000 people- in which 7,000 are kids- live and work inside a garbage dump.“Most survive by picking through the trash to earn less than five dollars a day. Many find their daily food in the dump.”Just when all hopelessness is lost for these human beings living in one of the most impoverished areas , more and more volunteers are stepping up to assist and steer them to a better life. Some local people have become very involved and formed an organization known as Beyond The Walls. This month, 75 individuals are volunteering to visit the Guatemala City Garbage Dump to build houses, donate clothing and shoes and organize sport clinics.The non-profit organization started in 2007 at the Mendham Hills Community Church, although mission teams were sent out before.“We had been going to Guatemala for a couple of years,” explains Betsy Ahl of Morris Township, executive director of Beyond The Walls. “The church was sending mission teams. We asked volunteers to help raise money to help pay for trips, build houses. They’d raise more money and that would go toward projects.”In order to influence others outside the church to get involved, and to receive matching grants from volunteers’ employers, organizers decided to expand the church group to a secular, non-profit organization, explains Ahl.The idea to help the people of Guatemala dates back to 2005, when Mendham was named one of the top wealthiest places to live in America.“The elders of Mendham Hills Chapel thought this wasn’t how others lived,” explains Ahl, “so they asked the chairman of the missions’ team to find an area that needed help.”One of the poorest places in the world, the Guatemala City Garbage Dump, was identified by a church member and the idea to team up with the Potter’s House organization, with a mission to eradicate poverty, build houses, help others get business loans and establish community programs.“It’s a ravine right in the center of the Capitol City,” describes Ahl. “They’ve been filling it up with garbage for 50 years.”In their first mission, Ahl joined 26 others for four days. The group, after that, “could have gone to Africa one year, China one year,” but the group decided it was more important to “come back and form long term relationships,” says Ahl who has sponsored three kids in Guatemala in the Kids In Potter House Education Program, in which 50 kids are sponsored to receive an education. Ahl has been sponsoring these kids since they were in the first grade, are now graduating high school and will be supported through college.Church member and organization volunteer, Mike Rubright, 50, of Long Valley, is currently on one of three missions to Guatemala this month through Beyond The Walls. His ninth trip out there during the past seven years, Rubright and his daughter, Erin, are working in the garbage dump from July 18-25.Another one of his daughters, Emily, has gone on the trip seven times but had to miss this one. Youth volunteers must be starting atleast seventh grade to participate, so for Erin this is her third trip. Volunteers must contribute $1,600 each in order to participate, with funds going toward flight and lodging; and additional funds to supplies and building houses. Every year, Rubright sends letters and emails to friends requesting donations to help support his volunteer work.About 75 people have signed up through Beyond The Walls to volunteer during the three missions this month, with 10 people from the Mendham, Long Valley and Chester areas. The others are from areas throughout the country such as Florida, New York and Texas, who formed their own groups with Beyond The Walls.Rubright and his wife, Katie, have a niece who was adopted from Guatemala so their connection is even greater.“I do construction all day long,” says Rubright. “I had no idea what I was doing; I had no construction experience. Now I’m the person in charge of construction projects my week.“Everybody builds, everybody works; it doesn’t matter how old you are,” says Rubright, principal at the Woodglen Middle School in Lebanon Twp.“We build a concrete block house with a concrete floor,” he explains. “We mix concrete by hand; it’s the hardest thing I’ve ever done. The girls and women work harder than I’ve ever seen; they don’t stop.” A family that is getting a house built works beside the volunteers.“It’s not very big,” he says, with the homes about 15 feet by 15 feet,” the size of a bedroom. Homes are for four to five person families, and sometimes six to eight people.It’s like “nine people living in the size of your kitchen,” describes Ahl. Homes are built side by side and cost $5,600 to build.A completed house consists of one big room with one eight-foot partition wall that separates the bedrooms from “everything else,” says Rubright. “They have a toilet and a shower stall” in an area about the size of a closet, and they get “a big concrete sink” that can weigh up to 600 pounds, which is used for all washing needs such as dishes and clothes.Rubright also works under Guatemala masons who are very particular with how they want things to be completed, he says.“They tell us what to do,” says Rubright. “There are a lot of times we do things that don’t make sense; you can’t tell them they are wrong. That’s frustrating. If they tell you to put a hole in a concrete pipe with a hammer and nails, instead of a drill, you do it.”The homes that are being built for the people in the Guatemala City Garbage Dump is luxury compared to the “cardboard sheet metal,” dirt, chemicals, methane gas that surround them and sicken them while living in the dump and “breathing the trash.”These houses also provide shelter and protection for these people, says Rubright, as gun shots are commonly fired in the garbage dump.His goal during this one week visit is to build three to five houses with his group of volunteers.Potter’s House has built 110 homes to date, with 75 contributed by the volunteers of Beyond The Walls, says Ahl, who visits four times, about six weeks a year.In addition to building homes, the volunteers lead soccer clinics and donate uniforms, soccer balls and cleats as well as baseball clinics and donations of t-shirts; help at a medical clinic, vacation Bible school, and deliver groceries and visit families.Through their efforts, much progress has been made such as concrete roads, a community center built last year, education programs which is much needed as the average kid does not go past fifth grade in Guatemala, says Rubright.“A lot of families look at education as not important,” says Rubright. “A lot end up working in the garbage dump” as scavengers. “They make money picking out recyclables. People sift through trash looking through recyclables to see what they can sell” or “they are looking for food to eat it.” Parents stop sending their kids to school because they need their school age kids to watch younger siblings so parents can work.If they are not scavengers, they rely on the garbage dump to sell their own goods, like tortillas to the scavengers so they can eat, and even jewelry, says Ahl.“It’s just this culture of poverty,” says Ahl, with high unemployment. “Education is not a value, that’s the bottom line. Potter’s House tries to teach the value of education especially to the parents.” It also tries to teach the vendors who do sell inside the garbage dump to sell on the outside, says Ahl.“But without education, it’s really, really hard to move their way out of the dump,” says Ahl.Scavengers are even making less these days. As the economy declined, so did the value of recyclables, explains Rubright. For those working 10 to 12 hour days, they are making two to three dollars.While “there are guns everywhere, “Rubright admits that he feels safe when there.“The organization we are with is well respected,” he says, and they stay in a retreat center with accommodations like that of a motel or college dorm. “We are safe; every store has an armed guard,” and no one walks alone. “We have relationships with people. We go to the same neighborhoods. There’s more of a comfort level now. It’s a safe place- I bring my kids there I’m not in fear of our lives.”It is the desire to help others and the appreciation that brings Rubright back to the dump.He says, “If there’s really a God, why does he let that happen? We let it happen by not choosing to use our resources that way. I don’t think I could not go back. They have so little but they appreciate everything they have. We have so much and we want so much more.”They say, “This morning I lived in a garbage dump; now I live in a mansion.”Rubright admits, “I’ve learned more from them than they get from me. I’m a better person in Guatemala than I am here.”Also nice is the community bond shared by the volunteers.For the last five or six years, the same group of people have been volunteering. “Everyone enjoys each other’s company,” say Rubright. “We work hard all day, you come back eat dinner. There’s community; there’s no television, little internet, no cell services. It’s a lot what life should be like.”Like Ahl, the Rubrights have sponsored a girl there since she was eight; now she is 17. Through their support they have helped Jennifer Lopez Munoz continue to go to school and get an education.Rubright tells people, “I have three daughters in America and one in Guatemala.”“All the kids down there, they know when we come back,” says Rubright. “It’s humbling; it’s like family.” Volunteers bring with them bags of clothing and shoes for more than 200 kids.Beyond the Walls has helped other communities outside of Guatemala, such as Native Americans, homeless people in Dover and in Newark.Rubright plans to volunteer at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota next, which is known as the poorest place in the U.S., next to Haiti, from alcoholism and unemployment faced by Native Americans. “This was their country and they are at the bottom of the ladder.”Beyond the Walls is always seeking more volunteers, contributions for clothing and shoes, and financial support.Its next mission to the garbage dump is Oct. 24-31, with already 20 people signed up.Go to Beyondthewalls.org for more information. To volunteer, email gobeyomdthewalls@gmail.com.“I encourage people to go, go somewhere,” says Rubright, Long Valley softball coach for the past 14 years and former school board member. “Find something to do where you can do something for someone else. There are people everywhere who need something. You do not need to be religious. Some people think it’s a church thing – it’s people helping other people.”Locals Volunteer To Build A Better Life In Guatemala added by new_view_media on August 18, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "By Jerry Del Priore  On September 13th, the Mayo Performing Arts Center (MPAC) kicked off its 25th anniversary with a fabulous concert by singer/actress and American Idol finalist Katherine McPhee. MPAC, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, has been at the center of Morristown’s revitalization and is a major reason why it’s a nightlife hotspot today, with several wonderful bars and restaurants lining its lively streets since its inception, according to General Manager Ed Kirchdoerffer. “Twenty-five years ago, Morristown wasn’t the popular town it is now,” Kirchdoerffer, a Morristown native, said. “We feel the opening of the performing arts center was part of the rebuilding of Morristown. It’s been an anchor for improvement.” Top musical and comedic acts have performed at MPAC over the years, from Foreigner and Daughtry to Melissa Ethridge and Wayne Brady, and every great entertainer in between. Moreover, MPAC doesn’t have any plans of slowing down any time soon. Musical performers such as America, Kenny G, Joan Jett and the Blackhearts and Ruben Studdard will be hitting the stage in October. “We feel we’re still in a growth cycle,” Kirchdoerffer said. “We constantly challenge ourselves to grow and invest in ourselves to make the best possible events.”  Kirchdoerffer said some of the ways MPAC will be celebrating its 25 years in Morristown are by holding a few free concerts, ask its performance-goers, on social media, to name their favorite moments since its opening, and have a number of $25 ticket offers, to name a few.  However, MPAC is more than a concert hall for some of today’s greatest acts. It also offers a Performing Arts School (PAS), founded in 2006, which now serves approximately 700 students per year with over 20 classes a week within a supportive and creative atmosphere. Students ages five to 18 come from all over Northern New Jersey to learn performance technique while building confidence and having a great time. Classes are offered in musical theatre, acting, singing technique, song presentation, improvisation, private voice and adult cabaret. “The emphasis isn’t placed on being a star,” Kirchdoerffer explained. “It’s placed on being part of a team, being part of the creative process. They really get a full immersive experience. Everyone’s so encouraging of everyone else.” While most of the kids don’t enter the entertainment world, Kirchdoerffer noted that they will gain valuable skills that will help them succeed in life. “Most won’t go on to become performers,” he said, “but they will learn important life skills that will go a long way, whether it’s in the boardroom or other areas of work.”Additionally, MPAC offers The Miracle Project, a fully inclusive music and theatre program for children with autism of all levels. “It’s been a very powerful program,” Kirchdoerffer said. “This is a program that grew organically. Many parents have spoken about (their experiences) and are happy to see their kids enjoy themselves. This (program) gives them a safe haven. They get to have fun while being themselves.” There’s also an Art Upstairs Gallery, located in the balcony lobby of MPAC, which showcases visual artists from a variety of disciplines, including watercolor, oils, photography, sculpture and more. Each year, the works of over 200 artists are showcased in group exhibits. Each display hangs from six to eight weeks.With all the success MPAC has experienced over the last 25 years, Kirchdoerffer said he hopes to see more prosperous years ahead for the Morristown institution, which has been a staple in the thriving town. “We have been here for 25 years and hope to do it for 25 more years and beyond,” he said. “It’s been the town’s heartbeat.” For more information on MPAC’s educational programs, Art Upstairs Gallery, and a list of upcoming performances, go to www.mayoarts.org. Mayo Performing Arts Center Celebrates 25 Years of Prosperity  added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "By Henry M. HoldenThe Morristown Festival of Books is an annual two-day event that takes place this year on October 11 and 12. According to Rachel Barry, Director of the Morristown Festival of Books, “The 6-year-old event is modeled after successful book festivals in other communities throughout the world. Each autumn, the festival brings together authors with readers and book lovers. The Festival is New Jersey’s premier book festival, celebrating the written word’s power to challenge, transport and transform.” Barry says the festival is growing each year. “We started with about 1,500 visitors six years ago and last year we hosted over 8,000.”The opening night is a ticketed Keynote Event featuring Preet Bharara who served as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York from 2009 to 2017. In 2017, Bharara joined the NYU School of Law faculty as a Distinguished Scholar in Residence. Bharara will speak on Friday evening at the Mayo Performing Arts Center at 7:30pm. Tickets will be available through the MPAC box office and on the festival website. Tickets are also available at the door on the night of the event, as availability allows.The Main Festival takes place all day on Saturday (10 a.m. – 5 p.m.), rain or shine.This year’s festival features more than 50 authors. Author selections featuring various genres are designed to appeal to a variety of ages and reading interests. “Authors will be speaking and answering questions in informal one-hour indoor sessions at five festival venues throughout the day,” said Barry. “Immediately following his or her talk, you will have the opportunity to speak with your favorite authors and have your books personalized at the Author Signing Tent, on the Vail Mansion lawn.” These sessions are free, no tickets required; general seating is on a first-come, first-served basis. There will also be portable restrooms at the Vail Mansion lawn. “The Festival center is on the lawn in front of the historic Vail Mansion (110 South Street), where there is an Information Tent, a Book Tent selling copies of the visiting authors’ books, the Signing Tent where authors will greet visitors and sign books, and concession stands selling refreshments.”“This year’s closing event is an exciting interactive event called Pitchapalooza,” said Barry. “It’s like American Idol for books (only without Simon). Anyone with an idea for a book has the chance to pitch it to a panel of judges. But they get only one minute.”The hosts, Arielle Eckstut and David Henry Sterry (a.k.a. The Book Doctors) team up with guest industry insiders to form the judging panel. The Judges critique everything from idea to style to potential in the marketplace and much more. Whether potential authors pitch themselves, or simply listen to trained professionals critique each presentation, Pitchapaloozas are educational and entertaining for all. All attendees come away with concrete advice on how to improve their pitch as well as a greater understanding of the ins and outs of the publishing industry.At the end of each Pitchapalooza, the judges come together to pick a winner. That winner receives an introduction by Eckstut and Sterry to an agent or publisher who is appropriate for their work. The Festival audience will also have a chance to pick a winning pitch. That Audience Choice winner will be voted on by the audience and will receive a 30-minute phone consultation from Eckstut and Sterry (a $150 value).KidFest @ MFOB includes author talks, signings, and fun activities all day for children up to 12 years old. Additionally, concessions will be available in the KidFest outdoor area outside the Presbyterian Church Parish House at 65 South Street. Please note, the festival is not held on the Morristown Green. There are several public parking garages within walking distance of the Festival center. This is a casual event. Wear comfortable walking shoes and be prepared for cool weather. It is a rain or shine event, so please bring an umbrella if the day’s weather warrants it. For more information and a list of authors attending see: www.morristownbooks.orgThe Morristown Festival of Books is Back added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "How To Combat Cold And Flu(NAPSI)—According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), chances are good you’ll get a cold or the flu this year. Adults have an average of two to three colds per year and children have even more, while 5 to 20 percent of the population gets the flu. Fortunately, there are steps you can take to minimize your risk and ease your symptoms.Consider these tips from Chloraseptic® pharmacist spokesperson Maria Mantione:• Get a flu shot. The CDC recommends a flu shot for everyone over the age of 6 months. It’s easy to get—just talk to your pharmacist. It’s the best way to prevent the spread of the flu. It does not prevent the common cold, but the flu is a devastating, serious illness that could put you out of commission for a week or more or, even worse, land you in the hospital with pneumonia or infect someone you love with a weaker immune system—such as babies, the elderly or those undergoing chemotherapy.• Wash your hands often. Washing your hands with soap and water is the best way to prevent the spread of the common cold.• Prevent illness by practicing healthy habits. Make sure to get enough sleep, eat a balanced, nutritious diet, exercise and minimize stress.• If you do get sick, talk to your pharmacist about how to manage your symptoms with medications. Before cold season, stock your medicine cabinet with the essentials. Stick to single-ingredient products, so you have what you need to treat your specific symptoms. These include pain relievers and fever reducers, a decongestant, cough medicine, lozenges and a sore throat spray. Topical medications, such as Chloraseptic sore throat sprays and lozenges, are great to have on hand because they’re portable, can be used safely with other cold medicines and have very few side effects.In fact, Chloraseptic is the No. 1 sore throat relief brand around. It provides fast-acting relief for sore throats and mouth pain to help you get through your day.From lozenges that soothe nasal passages and suppress coughs to sprays that target pain when and where it hurts, there’s a broad portfolio of products based on your preferences and needs.The lozenges have a soothing liquid center that relieves pain and cools nasal passages. MAX Wild Berry is the strongest throat relief lozenge in the line. Chloraseptic Total offers a multisymptom lozenge formula that can suppress your cough for up to four hours.Chloraseptic’s sprays are the No. 1 pharmacist-recommended brand. The new and improved Cherry Spray tastes great, works on contact and is free of aspirin, sugar and gluten. The MAX Wild Berry Targeted Throat Spray is convenient for travel or to keep in your purse. The targeted spray makes it easier when you’re on the go to coat and protect specific areas in your mouth and throat. All these products are available at mass retailers, major drugstores and grocery stores.Also helping to keep you ahead of the flu this season is an online Cold + Flu tracker. To check for outbreaks and symptoms, go to www.chloraseptic.com, click on Cold + Flu Tracker and enter your zip code.How To Combat Cold And Flu added by new_view_media on December 22, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Helping Older People to Maintain Independence(NAPSI)—For most older adults, the ability to live independently is associated with the ability to drive. That’s one reason the prospect of eventually “giving up the keys” can be a frightening one.To help, the experts on aging at the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging (n4a) developed a brochure called “Before You Give Up the Keys: Create a Roadmap for Transportation Independence” that may lessen those fears by empowering older adults to evaluate their mobility needs, identify the transportation options in their community and develop a plan customized to their unique circumstances.“A too-familiar scenario is that older adults wait until they’re involved in some sort of emergency, like a traffic accident, before they really think about their driving ability and the other transportation options available to them in their community,” said n4a CEO Sandy Markwood. “Our goal is to shed light on a critical issue that will likely affect most families with an older loved one who may need to limit or eliminate their driving, and to provide a catalyst for discussion, and hopefully, action,” Markwood also noted.The n4a represents America’s national network of 623 Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs). It helps older adults and people with disabilities live with dignity and choices in their homes and communities for as long as possible.To that end, it created the Eldercare Locator. This serves as an essential, trusted gateway to help older adults, caregivers and health professionals navigate the maze of aging programs and services, as well as to assist them in identifying and accessing the resources that match their needs best. The National Call Center operates five days a week from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET and can be reached at 800-677-1116 or www.eldercare.gov.According to recent research by the Federal Transit Administration, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, n4a and the National Aging and Disability Transportation Center, the rise in the 65-plus population—some 45 million and growing—has triggered a corresponding spike in the number of nondrivers of more than 1.1 million between 2001 and 2009.“This is a major issue for older adults because when they lack access to transportation, they can’t get to the doctor, the grocery store or see friends and family as much, which means their overall well-being is likely to suffer,” added Kathy Greenlee, Assistant Secretary for Aging.Free BrochureTo download the free brochure, go to www.n4a.org/files/ResourcesforOlderAdults.pdf.

      "Protect Your Health, Protect Your Toothbrush(NAPSI)—Did you know that keeping your toothbrush clean is a simple way to help protect your health and the health of your loved ones year-round, and especially during flu season?Dentists’ Advice for the Entire FamilyAccording to pediatric dentist Danielle Gilbert-Fowler, D.M.D., “Oral health is not just about your mouth, it’s about your overall health. The mouth is a major doorway for all sorts of microorganisms, which can be linked to anything from the common cold to heart disease and diabetes. Hence, the importance of having a healthy mouth cannot be overstated.”“More than 300 kinds of microorganisms thrive in the human mouth,” explains Astrid Shroetter, D.D.S. “What’s more, the typical toothbrush is reused for months and never cleaned thoroughly.”Research indicates that kids get sick on average about 10 times a year—that’s almost once a month. While dentists and parents both encourage good oral hygiene, it would be nice to do so without worrying about potential reinfection caused by brushing teeth with contaminated toothbrushes. As Dr. Gilbert-Fowler puts it, “You wouldn’t clean your house with a dirty washcloth. Why clean your teeth with a dirty toothbrush?”A Solution“It’s important to keep toothbrushes in a clean environment and separate from other toothbrushes,” recommends Gilbert-Fowler. “Use of a Steripod® clip-on toothbrush protector will help keep your toothbrush clean and protect against outside contaminants and cross contamination from other toothbrushes. It’s important for kids and adults alike to replace toothbrushes every three months or more frequently after any illness.”Developed by doctors and independently tested for efficacy at an accredited lab, Steripod is a clip-on protector that fits any standard or electric toothbrush. Using a patented natural vapor shield of thymol, derived from the thyme plant, Steripod keeps toothbrushes fresh and clean for up to three months. Simply clip it on your electric or manual toothbrush and it goes to work; no cables or batteries are needed. You can use it at home, work, the gym, school or when you travel.More Pearls of Wisdom for Your Pearly Whites:To further put the bite on dental disease, heed these five tips from the experts at the American Dental Association:1. Brush your teeth twice a day for two minutes with a soft-bristled brush.2. Replace your toothbrush every three or four months, or if the bristles are frayed.3. Use an ADA-accepted fluoride toothpaste.4. Clean between teeth daily with floss.5. Visit your dentist regularly for professional cleanings and oral exams.Learn MoreVisit www.GetSteripod.com or call (310) 204-7880.Protect Your Health, Protect Your Toothbrush added by new_view_media on December 22, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "6 Tips for Planning Your Wedding Photos Like a Pro\n",
      "Five words or less(NewsUSA) – With everything that goes into your wedding day, those once-in-a-lifetime moments will go by in a blur, which is why hiring a professional wedding photographer is a must. After all, the last thing you should be worrying about is whether your photographer will be able to capture your big day.\n",
      "The key? Prepare yourself so that you can accurately evaluate the “right” photographer for you.\n",
      "“The best photographer will take the time to build a rapport with you and use his or her experience and creativity to capture the mood, personality, ambiance and even the geography of your wedding,” says PPA (Professional Photographers of America) photographer Berit Bizjak. “The finest wedding photography is more than a series of still pictures. It’s physical poetry — it tells the story of the day and portrays the essence of both people and place.”\n",
      "To this end, PPA, the largest international nonprofit association created by professional photographers, has taken the guesswork out of the process by offering six tips to help you plan your wedding photos like a pro:\n",
      "1. Book far in advance. The best photographers get booked quickly — sometimes as much as a year in advance — so don’t wait until the last minute to book your photographer.\n",
      "2. Show them the money. Now is not the time to skimp on your photo budget. Call around and get a price range for services, and remember: after the cake is long gone, and the dress is stored away, your wedding photos will be the only things left to share and enjoy for years to come, so don’t cut too many corners on your photography budget — you’ll end up regretting it.\n",
      "3. Make sure your photographer is a real pro. Only hire someone who has liability insurance, experience taking the style of photos you want, backup equipment and a plan for when things go south. Ideally, he or she is a PPA photographer. PPA photographers do more than just snap pictures. They have the technical expertise and artistry to make you look your best and bring your vision to life. They also abide by a strict code of ethics that makes a real difference. Watch this (video) to see real married couples share their stories.\n",
      "4. Request to see a full gallery of real weddings. Look at full wedding coverage (not just a small selection of each wedding’s best moments) to see a photographer’s true style and get a sense of how he or she might tell your “story.” Do you prefer more artistic or traditional poses? Would you rather have a photojournalist approach or a mix of all styles?\n",
      "5.Work with your photographer to create a detailed shot list. PPA wedding photographers can also help you create that shot list, as they know what key moments tell a wedding story and can prepare for those. But talk about your must-haves, and walk through the entire program with your photographer ahead of time. Share your expectations ahead of time to ensure that he or she captures the key shots, while remaining attentive and available to catch the best candid moments.\n",
      "6. Plan your post-wedding photo strategy• ahead of time! Almost as soon as the festivities are over, you’ll be eager to look at the photos so you can relive your big day over and over again. Ask your photographer for teasers or a “sneak peek” and a timeline for when the rest of the pictures will be available. Will they give you an online gallery for family and friends to choose the images they want? Again, knowing these things ahead of time will make things easy on the back end, sparing you any heartache.6 Tips for Planning Your Wedding Photos Like a Pro added by new_view_media on December 22, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Wedding Gifts for Grooms: A Tradition Brides Shouldn’t Ignore\n",
      "Five words or less(NewsUSA) – The answer is: Yes, it’s expected.\n",
      "But it’s also a chance for all you brides out there to truly show you know that not everything is about you on your wedding day. That there really is another person involved (that would be the groom) who deserves a bit of recognition, too.\n",
      "We’re talking wedding presents — specifically, yours to your husband-to-be.\n",
      "Tradition does, indeed, hold that both you and he exchange gifts. And while it’s true that some guys are initially shocked to learn your engagement ring doesn’t also count as a “present,” that’s no excuse for you to waver.\n",
      "“Giving him something that’s just for him will make him feel really special,” advises BrideBox.com.\n",
      "Here’s what you need to know now that it’s prime time for weddings:\n",
      "* When to exchange them. Etiquette dictates that the hand-off occurs at one of three times: the night before the wedding, the morning of the ceremony, or right before leaving on your honeymoon. Think it’s bad luck to see the groom before the nuptials? “Many couples choose to courier gifts via bridesmaids or groomsmen just before the ceremony,” says Brides.com.\n",
      "* There’s a thin line between “romantic” and “mushy.” Some of you may be tempted to compile a “love notes” journal of every bit of correspondence you’ve ever sent your groom. Even assuming he’s the type who wouldn’t consider that a bit “over the top,” there’s always the chance he might be left wondering, “Okay, where’s my real present?”– especially if his gift to you is a serious piece of jewelry.\n",
      "* The consensus choice. There’s a reason a watch invariably makes everyone’s short list: It’s the perfect statement of who he is or aspires to be. (It’s also a lot more impressive than a flask, which for some reason also gets a few votes).\n",
      "No less a taste arbiter than MarthaStewartWeddings.com favors Baume & Mercier’s Clifton line — as elegant as the original 1950s model that inspired it — for the way it “easily transitions from big day to every day.” Like the Swiss watchmaker’s timelessly charming (and affordably luxurious) Classima line, it comes with a choice of straps, dial faces and a variety of what’s known as “small complications” that go way beyong just telling the hour. You can shop them at the Baume & Mercier e-boutique or by calling 1-800-MERCIER, where free engraving and wrapping are available.\n",
      "* Fun fact. One writer at AskMen.com says he’s “heard of women giving their husbands watches in the ceremony instead of a wedding ring.” If so, the answer is: No, just like your engagement ring, that wouldn’t also qualify as a wedding present.Wedding Gifts for Grooms: A Tradition Brides Shouldn’t Ignore added by new_view_media on December 22, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Want to Increase Revenue? Take Your Business Global(NAPSI)—International selling may seem daunting, but thanks to the Internet, it’s more attainable than ever. With the right tools in place, small businesses can go global and increase revenues without the headache.The question then is, “Where should I sell?” Consider these two destinations as you map out your plan for international growth:CanadaCanadians are e-commerce enthusiasts—in fact, 60 percent of Canada’s online shoppers buy from U.S.-based sellers. As an added bonus, there’s typically no language barrier for U.S. businesses selling into Canada.Given this opportunity for U.S. small businesses, the U.S. Postal Service opted to create zone-based pricing for all Priority Mail International® shipments headed to Canada starting on May 31, 2015.This means that the USPS will charge for shipping based on the U.S. origin ZIP code and the Canada destination postal code, instead of blending expensive routes into one flat rate.There will now be seven pricing zones for shipping. Some rates will increase, but for businesses in major cities—such as San Francisco, Miami and Chicago—savings will be around $8 per package.BrazilLatin America is the world’s second-fastest-growing e-commerce market, and leading this boom is Brazil. With 202 million citizens, of whom 33.5 million shop online, Brazil presents a huge opportunity for U.S.-based businesses looking to expand, though it’s not without its challenges.Due to delays in customs clearance, postal packages could take up to 20 days to arrive. Duties and taxes, as well as complicated custom forms, slow the process for both U.S. merchants and the buyers.However, there are solutions. Shipping technology company Endicia just launched a program called Endicia Global Service, which allows shipments from U.S. businesses to reach Brazilian customers in as little as 8 days. Additionally, duties and taxes can be paid by the buyer up front, and there are no complicated customs forms to fill out.“International selling is a great way to grow a business and secure additional revenue,” said Endicia co-founder and general manager Amine Khechfé. “These markets in particular are undergoing massive growth, and there’s never been a better time for small businesses to look into them.”To learn about the tools you need to succeed in going global, check out www.endicia.com/go-global.Want to Increase Revenue?

      "(BPT) – Remember free time? You used to have so much of it. But these days, work and family obligations have you running around constantly and you don’t know what to do first. You don’t even have time to do everything you have to do, let alone what you want to do.So how do you take back your day? How do you find the time to get things done and bring back some semblance of order? It is possible if you focus on making yourself more efficient. To help you accomplish all of your goals and find some free time as well, here are four ways you can improve your efficiency every single day.* Make a plan. When you’re running through your list of daily obligations the morning of, it’s easy to forget a thing or two, especially if you have children running around, phones ringing or dogs barking to distract you. Instead, plan out the upcoming day the night before. Make a list of everything you have to do and check these items against one another. Can two trips be combined? Are you prioritizing the most important things first? The better you can plan out your schedule, the more organized you’ll be the next day.* Get the news and information you need ASAP. You are bombarded by digital content every day and some of it is really important – but who has time to sift through it all? To help you find the information you need as quickly as possible, Fresly LLC launched a new app, iNews Photo. Whether you are on the go, or gathering news in your office this application allows you access to global and local news curated in real time by former journalist directly to your mobile phone or on a larger screen.* Set priorities. You don’t have time to do it all and maybe you don’t have to. Sit down and make a list of every social or professional group and obligation you belong to. Once you’ve made the list, look at it and ask yourself honestly how important this obligation is to you or your family. If you find the obligation is not essential, you’re better off to abandon it and save your time for the responsibilities that are more important to you.* Limit multitasking. Many people look to multitasking as an efficiency solution, but doing several things at once means it takes longer to accomplish any one task. And when the first task is completed, the result is often poorer because of it. Instead of trying to do several things at once, focus on the most important thing, accomplish it and move on.With today’s hectic schedules, finding the opportunity to do everything you’re supposed to do may seem impossible. However, if you apply the four tips listed above, you’ll improve your efficiency, stay up on the latest news and maybe even discover that elusive free time you sorely deserve.

      "medical workers working together in hospital(BPT) – Over the last decade, a number of changes have transformed the healthcare industry. The Affordable Care Act has enabled more than 16.4 million Americans to receive healthcare coverage. Advancements in technology improve both diagnoses and treatment quality. Retail health offers a convenience used by more than 10 million patients at 1,800 retail health locations. Along with the current challenges facing the healthcare system, such as an aging population, increased patient volume and physician shortages, these changes prompt the expansion of the traditional role of a nurse.Generally, Americans believe nurses’ roles are expanding as they share increased responsibilities to support the delivery of high quality healthcare, according to a poll commissioned by University of Phoenix College of Health Professions. The survey also found that adults in the United States view their experience with nurses as overwhelmingly positive. In fact, 95 percent found nurses to be a valuable addition to the healthcare system as a whole, and 87 percent view nurses as trusted sources of health information.“As nurses take on greater responsibility, and as the needs of healthcare organizations continue to grow more complex, the skills and training requirements of nurses must be prepared to match this growth,” says Betty Nelson, Ph.D., RN, and academic dean for University of Phoenix School of Nursing. “This is especially important given that the United States is currently facing a shortage of as many as 90,000 physicians by 2025.. Nurses with advanced education can help fill this shortage, particularly in areas where consumers do not have access to care.”Because of this, employers are looking for nurses with a variety of skills and certifications including:* Additional degrees or seeking an advanced degree* In-demand skills such as bilingualism, leadership and critical thinking* Flexibility and professionalism* The desire to grow into advanced practitioners such as nurse practitioners and physician assistants* Specialized training for working with various populations* An openness to diverse opportunities in a number of different facilitiesIn order to keep up with the changes in the healthcare system, at least 80 percent of the nation’s nursing workforce will need a bachelor’s degree by 2020 and the number of nurses with doctoral degrees will need to be double, according to the Institute of Medicine. Nursing education institutions play a critical role in meeting the needs of today’s healthcare system. Nurses need a place to obtain these degrees and further their skills within the healthcare industry. Institutions recognize the expanding role of the 21st century nurse and are offering a wide range of curriculum and degree programs that address recent changes in the delivery of primary care. Graduates need to be equipped with the skills they need to succeed in today’s health care market.It’s now more important than ever that nurses have the training and skills to match the demands of the growing profession. Along with the nursing community, institutions that offer nursing degree programs must work together to enhance and better prepare the nursing workforce.What employers look for in the 21st century nurse added by new_view_media on November 15, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "(BPT) – What image does the word “grilling” bring to mind? Do you envision thick, juicy burgers or steaks? What about sauce-slathered chicken breasts sizzling over coals? Cooking out is one of the great joys of warm weather, but if you leave side dishes out of your grilling plans – or stick with cold sides like salads – you’re missing out on some great flavors.Side dishes give you a chance to really show off your grilling chops, savor the farm fresh flavors of summer harvests, and indulge in wholesome, organic fare. Here are six summer side dishes that go great on the grill:1. Corn on the cob – If you’ve always wanted to try grilling vegetables but weren’t sure which of your favorites would go well on the grill – take heart! Virtually any veggie can be prepared on a grill, but corn becomes a show-stopper when grilled. Remove the husks and silk and toss the cobs right on a preheated grill. Watch them careful and keep turning them to ensure they brown but don’t burn. The heat from the grill causes the natural sugars in the corn to carmelize, and you’ll end up with the sweetest sweet corn you ever tasted!2. Fries – A trip to the grocery store or farmer’s market for fresh produce may not fit in your schedule if you’re grilling on the fly. There’s good news – frozen options like Alexia Organic Oven Crinkles with Sea Saltdeliver farm to flavor taste when prepared on the grill or in the oven. Made from Pacific Northwest russet potatoes, Alexia’s organic fries are sprinkled with bright sea salt to bring out even more of the rich flavor that Mother Nature delivered. Make a tray out of aluminum foil, spread the Oven Crinkles in a single layer, and grill for about 20-25 minutes at 400-450 degrees F. Turn once or twice during the cooking process.3. Tomatoes – If you’ve only grilled small tomatoes on a kabob, or never tried grilled tomatoes at all, this is your summer to discover grilling tomatoes couldn’t be easier. Start with large, meaty tomatoes – a variety that’s dense and has fewer seeds works best. Slice in half, brush with your favorite seasoned oil and place the halves cut-side down on the grill. Cook for 3-5 minutes on each side. Top with your favorite cheese when done.4. Kale – Grilling greens like kale helps all those wonderful nutrients and flavor stay in the vegetable and don’t disappear into the cooking water – which is what can happen when you boil veggies on the stovetop. Grilling kale couldn’t be easier. You can adapt virtually any of your favorite kale recipes to grilling by tossing the kale with the recipe seasonings and some oil. Arrange the seasoned leaves in a single layer on the grill and they’ll cook to crispy splendor in just minutes.5. Cheese – A slice of gooey melted cheese is the crowning glory atop your grilled burger, but cheese can also handle the grill on its own, and be a delicious, different side dish or appetizer. Many cheeses will work on the grill, and you can find recommendations for the best cheeses to cook on the grill with a simple online search. Slice your chosen cheese in thick pieces. Most grilling cheeses will need minimal seasoning and little or no oil. Generally, cheese takes just a minute or two to brown each side and allow the inside to melt.6. Dinner rolls – Craving dinner rolls to go with that thick juicy steak, but in no mood to fire up the oven when it’s 90 degrees outside? You can make frozen dinner rolls on the grill. Choose your favorite variety, such as Alexia Artisan French Rolls or Artisan Focaccia Rolls, set your gas grill to the temperature recommended on the package’s directions, wrap the rolls in foil and place directly on the grill. Keep an eye on the rolls to ensure they don’t burn as they can cook quickly on a grill.6 summer sides you never knew you could grill added by new_view_media on April 3, 2016View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "(BPT) – Traditional wedding rules have fallen by the wayside – food trucks are in, having a hashtag is a must, bridesmaids no longer wear the same dress and groomsmen are sometimes in sneakers. Couples are actively seeking ways to differentiate themselves and get creative. All that aside, there is one thing that remains constant – weddings must have wine.Without wine, there is no glass to raise during the toast to the bride and groom and nothing to drink when the bar closes during dinner. Wine is the first thing guests are offered when they take a seat, and – you know that they say – it’s important to make a good first impression.Choosing the right varietals for your wedding does not have to be a stressful endeavor. Whether you’re a novice wine drinker or a connoisseur, follow these four tips and you’ll please a crowd without spending a fortune:Say “cheers!” with a sparkling wine.People love a good toast, and nothing washes down a teary maid of honor speech like a glass of sparkling. Riondo Prosecco is an accessible option that’s ideal to enjoy any day of the year, but perfectly suited for special occasions. You’ll get six pours out of a bottle, so plan accordingly!Good things come in threes.In addition to a sparkling, you’ll want a red and a white option that are familiar and food-friendly. You can’t go wrong with a Merlot – look for labels from the Napa region. For a white, Terlato Friuli Pinot Grigio is exceptional and ideal for food pairing.Wine math: What you didn’t learn in school.Running out of wine mid-wedding isn’t an option, so it’s important to do the math. You should anticipate getting about 5 glasses per bottle and assume that each guest will drink one glass per hour. Follow this rule and the wine will flow all night long, keeping you and your guests happy.Don’t break the bank, but stay away from the cheap stuff.Choosing an excellent wine doesn’t mean paying top-dollar, but buying too cheap can mean sacrificing quality. There are countless high-quality, delicious, wines available for $10-$20 per bottle, so leave the cheap stuff on the bottom shelf!4 wine buying tips for weddings added by new_view_media on April 3, 2016View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "(BPT) – Around-the-clock food shows, celebrity guests and niche themed restaurants are just a few reasons the fine food movement continues to experience extraordinary growth. In 2016, more people will be seeking upscale dining experiences that focus on the unique to the luxurious — and they’re willing to pay big bucks to do so.In fact, Americans said they would splurge an average of $203 in order to have a once-in-a-lifetime dining experience at a gourmet restaurant, according to a recent online survey by Harris Poll sponsored byMichelin, the global tire maker that publishes the popular restaurant guide.What’s surprising is the people willing to pay the most for fine dining experiences are younger generations. Millennials (ages 18-34) on average would pay $282 for this culinary experience, compared to diners ages 45-54 who would shell out $170, and $122 for those 65 and older.One explanation for why younger diners are willing to pay so much is that they want to enjoy more than just fine cuisine. Many restaurants offer an overall experience that will be remembered long after the last morsel of food is gone. Whether it’s an incredible atmosphere, the opportunity to observe the chef work or gaining access to foods and cooking styles never available before, this desire for an experience is driving younger diners to invest in upscale dining.As America looks at the most recent Michelin star ratings to navigate the nation’s best eateries, there are some food and restaurant trends that are positioned to grow in 2016. Chefs will continue to expand their creative prowess by experimenting with new cooking styles and food fusions. Cooking methods will blend with science and art to create uniquely fine fare with a story that is as intriguing as the taste.Diversity is another notable trend for 2016. Authentic ethnic cuisine is in high demand and restaurants are answering the call. Traditional restaurants will begin to offer diverse plates in addition to timeless favorites to appeal to a wide range of palates. Expect to see more ancient grains, ethnic spices and worldly condiments at eateries in the future.Conscious dining is a growing trend thanks to diners’ increasing awareness of where their food comes from. Hyper-local sourcing of ingredients is being adopted by many notable restaurants. This includes growing fresh herbs and vegetables onsite and partnering with local farms for incredibly fresh dairy and meat products. Sustainable seafood partnerships are another effort by restaurants that supports the increasing demand for responsible dining options.Finally, diners are seeking chefs with the best reputation for tried-and-true favorites.

      "Be Well Tressed Every Day With Wigs(NAPSI)—Changing your hair to suit your hat, your mood or your outfit-or to make holidays and other celebrations that much more special—can be easier and more fun than ever.TV Star’s IdeaExplains Daytime Emmy Award winner Sherri Shepherd, “When I was a little girl, I would hear all this commotion in my house from my mom, aunts and grandmother when picking out their wigs for the day. It was such a good time for them and was a major part of their everyday beauty routines. Ever since then, I’ve watched the women in my household glow with confidence because they would customize their look day by day through the use of faux hair. My grandmother had a wig that she would pick out and wear perfectly with specific hats. My mother had an Angela Davis ‘power to the people’ wig. Watching these iconic women in my life pair their hair lengths, styles and colors with particular hats, outfits and personalities was exciting. Getting ready to go out was like an event in and of itself. Wigs are the perfect way for the inner diva in all women to come out and get creative, which is why I was inspired to start my own wig line to give women the choices to create their own style and look.“I always say, you were born with the hair you’ve got—now get the hair you want. Short and sassy, long and sexy or curly and fierce; you can easily change your hairstyle and transform your whole look to fit whatever your day brings. This is one of the reasons I wanted to create my line of wigs for Luxhair—I wanted to be able to give busy women high-quality, versatile looks to choose from that were simple and quick to put on but that were affordable and wouldn’t break their budget too.”The result is the Luxhair Now by Sherri Shepherd high-fashion wig and extension collection. “The collection provides the look you want, the style you want and the perfect accent to make a personal style statement, now.”Why WigsLike putting on your most stylish shoes and more powerful than a red lipstick, Shepherd says, these high-fashion styles can add some fabulous to your everyday. They can also be an excellent accessory to have during the holiday season when you want a party perfect ‘do but don’t want to spend a lot of time getting it. With a variety of lace front styles that give the appearance of natural hair growth, allow for styling away from the face and heat-friendly fiber, these wigs stand up to heat and humidity, offer styling options, and look, feel and move like real hair.What’s NewNow that Luxhair Now by Sherri Shepherd has partnered with national retailer Sally Beauty Supply, two new fun wig styles are available in over 1,900 stores nationwide.• Textured Pixie is a sassy pixie wig that features choppy texture for maximum volume and style along with precision-cut bangs that frame the face. It comes in medium dark brown, medium and light auburn and golden brown with auburn highlights.• The Feathered Pixie is a short, side-swept pixie with feathered texture and volume.

      "On National Senior Citizens Day, Three Ways To Celebrate The Older Generation(NAPSI)—Whether it’s your parents, grandparents, aunt, uncle or neighbor, you likely received guidance from or looked to older people in your life as you’ve tried to become more independent and deal with change and everyday challenges. August 21 is National Senior Citizens Day, and it’s an ideal time to honor seniors for the wisdom and care they have provided us, and also to celebrate the members of the older generation by finding ways to enhance their lives as they age.There’s No Place Like HomeNearly 90 percent of seniors want to age in place—stay in their own homes as they get older. But one out of three seniors suffers a fall each year, according to the CDC. Making an older person’s home as safe as possible is integral to helping him or her maintain this independence. Walking through seniors’ daily routine with them, from the time they get out of bed to when they go back to sleep, can reveal patterns in how they navigate their home and any potential hazards. By identifying the areas of concern and making necessary adjustments, you can decrease the risk of an accident and seniors can reside more confidently in their own home.Stay ConnectedTechnology now allows grandparents to FaceTime their children and grandchildren across the globe or even in the next town, and seniors to reconnect with classmates of decades past via Facebook. Older generations can create, build and maintain quality social relationships with the convenience and ease of social media. Seniors have a multitude of online outlets to share updates, photos and videos with loved ones. To help them stay in touch, ensure that the seniors in your life have reliable Internet connectivity, and help them set up social media accounts if they don’t have one already. In-person interaction is ideal, but keeping in touch through computers, tablets and smartphones is a great way to supplement seeing and speaking with each other.Everyone’s Wearing TechnologyWearable technology like the Apple Watch is popular among younger audiences, but wearable fitness trackers and medical alert devices can provide great benefits to seniors as well. In the event of a fall or accident where it’s impossible to get to a phone to call for help, a medical alert device immediately connects the injured to emergency services. Because that person’s medical history and health needs are on file, first responders can more easily treat them. With help a push of a button away, medical alert devices give seniors peace of mind even beyond health concerns. In fact, a recent survey by Bay Alarm Medical found that 80 percent of medical alert device wearers worry less when their adult children travel because they feel the device provides an adequate support system. If you decide to help protect the senior in your life with a wearable medical alert system, it’s also wise to look for a caring, people-first, ethical provider. Bay Alarm Medical, for example, implemented a Code of Ethics it follows for uncompromisingly ethical and transparent business practices. The company vows to prioritize customers over sales, make pricing publicly accessible and never pressure customers into a product or service they do not need, among other safeguards.National Senior Citizens Day is a day to commemorate the great ways in which seniors have helped us and we should show them how thankful we are every day. Simple steps such as a home safety walk-through, staying connected and providing the tools to enhance their physical and emotional well-being can go a long way in reducing the stress of aging for seniors and their loved ones.On National Senior Citizens Day, Three Ways To Celebrate The Older Generation added by new_view_media on December 24, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Don’t Let The Flu Mean Missing Memorable Moments(NAPSI)—While the cold and flu season often coincides with holiday celebrations and family get-togethers, there are preventative measures that families can take to stay healthy and not miss out.To help you get to the next “can’t miss” life event, consider these top preventative tips:• Get an annual flu shot. It’s the most effective way to help prevent the spread of influenza. For your convenience, you can get a vaccine at any of the more than 7,800 CVS/pharmacy and 900 MinuteClinic locations across the country. The flu shot is available every day with no appointment needed, including evenings and weekends.As a preventive service under the Affordable Care Act, it’s fully covered and available at no cost through most insurance plans, including Medicare Part B.The pharmacy can also be a one-stop shop for flu prevention resources, including over-the-counter cold and flu remedies, multivitamins and anti-bacterial cleaning products. Plus, anyone enrolled in the ExtraCare Rewards program gets a 20 percent off CVS Shopping Pass upon getting the flu shot in most places.• Seniors, take extra precaution. There’s a high-dose flu shot designed for those 65 and older, who have a greater risk of severe illness from the flu.• Plan ahead: the earlier, the better. It takes up to two weeks for your immunity to build up after getting a flu shot. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone who is at least 6 months old get a flu shot as soon as the vaccine is available.• Stay home if you’re ill. While it may seem like a no-brainer, two-thirds of employed Americans would still go to work even if they were feeling ill with flu-like symptoms. It’s important to understand the preliminary symptoms of the flu and, if you experience them, to stay home. This will help bolster your immune system and prevent the germs spreading.• Practice healthy habits. Door handles, desks and other everyday items are ridden with germs. Wash your hands frequently with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds and avoid touching your mouth and eyes. Additionally, eat nutritious foods, drink plenty of water, and get sufficient sleep to keep your immune system in top shape. Lead by example to educate children about these habits.Learn MoreFor further information and to find a nearby store, visit www.cvs.com/flu or download the CVS/pharmacy mobile app.Don’t Let The Flu Mean Missing Memorable Moments added by new_view_media on December 24, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Medicare Open Enrollment: What You Need To Knowby Patricia Smith(NAPSI)—Every year, millions of Medicare beneficiaries must decide which Medicare Advantage (MA) plan will best serve their needs. During Medicare’s annual open enrollment period, October 15-December 7, you can change MA plans or enroll in one for the first time. Important factors to consider include premium costs, choice of doctors and plan benefits. But there is one other important question: What is the quality rating of the plan?Quality is important because it means better health care and the best value for your money. Medicare uses a system called Star Ratings to assess the quality of plans, awarding plans from one to five stars. These ratings are based on many factors, such as how well the plan does in keeping people healthy and preventing illness, how quickly you can get an appointment and see specialists, and how the plan responds to your complaints and concerns.Today, 65 percent of MA enrollees are in plans with four stars or more, compared to 17 percent in 2009. Eight of the 12 MA plans earning five stars this year are members of the Alliance of Community Health Plans, an organization representing high-quality health plans.You can learn more about MA plans using the Medicare Plan Finder at www.Medicare.gov. The National Committee for Quality Assurance also evaluates quality in MA plans at www.ncqa.org.• Ms. Smith is the president and CEO of the Alliance of Community Health Plans, www.achp.org.Medicare Open Enrollment: What You Need To Know added by new_view_media on December 24, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "How To Plan A Smooth Group Ski Trip(NAPSI)—According to a study from Wyndham Vacation Rentals, most travelers take ski and snowboard vacations in groups of four or more. Hitting the slopes with a big group doesn’t have to be hard, even when it comes to coordinating everyone’s schedules and travel arrangements.Group Ski Trip TipsWhile it can be challenging to keep everyone happy during the vacation, these planning hints can help get everyone started on the right foot.• Find the right lodging. When traveling with a larger group, alternative lodging options might be your best bet. A cabin, condo or home lets everyone stay together under one roof without sacrificing privacy. Everyone can have his or her own bedroom, while common spaces such as a living room or dining room make spending time together easy. Most rental homes also feature a kitchen, which can cut down on the stress of dining out as a large group. Have everyone take a night to prepare dinner. You’ll not only save money, you’ll enjoy time together without the interruptions of a busy restaurant.• Plan for transportation. When researching lodging, see if your accommodations rest along a community shuttle route or offer their own shuttle services. Also look into the destination’s transit systems. Sun Valley, for example, offers free bus service. If you’re renting a car, make sure you plan for times when the group splits up. Leaving half the group stranded won’t make for a fun situation.• Agree on activities beforehand. While skiing and snowboarding may be the top priorities, there are plenty of other activities to do during a ski trip. From dogsledding and snow tubing to unique local festivals, you might find attractions you just don’t want to miss. Have everyone weigh in on top choices before the trip, especially those who are attending but who aren’t avid skiers or snowboarders. Considering everyone’s preferences in advance can help reduce stress during the trip itself.• Give everyone some downtime. Opinions often differ, especially within larger groups, so allow for flexibility during the trip. If your muscles are begging for a break, read a book or squeeze in a post-run nap while your fellow travelers stay on the slopes. If half of the group wants to head downtown for the afternoon while the other half wants to get in another mountain activity, split up for a few hours. By staying flexible with the group’s itinerary, you’ll avoid any tension and better enjoy the time you all spend together.Learn MoreTo start your planning now, you can visit www.WyndhamVacationRentals.com for deals on vacation rental homes in some of North America’s top ski destinations.How To Plan A Smooth Group Ski Trip added by new_view_media on December 22, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Triple Sorghum Granola(Family Features) As you look to the new year with plans for healthier habits, there’s no better place to start than the beginning – the beginning of each day, that is. Countless studies have shown the benefits of a nutritious breakfast as part of a healthy eating plan, and there are plenty of options to make a good-for-you breakfast that tastes great, too.Experts agree that there are numerous health benefits to breakfast. For example, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics credits breakfast with helping brain function and memory as well as preventing tiredness and overeating as the day wears on. Mayo Clinic staff adds that adults who eat breakfast are likely to consume more vitamins and minerals, and less fats and cholesterol.Wake up your morning routine with these tips for a healthier start to each day:Plan a well-rounded meal. Incorporate whole grains, like sorghum, lean protein, low-fat dairy and fruits and vegetables, for a nutrient-rich meal that will keep you fueled and feeling full until lunch time.Experiment with new flavors. Avoid burnout and boredom by trying new foods. For example, substitute your typical grain with sorghum, an American-grown cereal grain. In addition to its delicious flavor, sorghum is a highly versatile ingredient that is naturally high in fiber, iron and protein and can be used in a wide range of preparations.Eliminate obstacles. If hectic mornings are preventing you from getting a healthy breakfast, find solutions that work for you and your family. Prepare make-ahead foods that you can heat in minutes or look for options that are easy to eat on the go, such as this Triple Sorghum Granola, which can be made ahead and stored in an airtight container to maintain its crunchy texture.Find more ideas for incorporating sorghum into your healthy new year at Facebook.com/TasteSorghum.

      "By Jerry Del Priore  On September 13th, the Mayo Performing Arts Center (MPAC) kicked off its 25th anniversary with a fabulous concert by singer/actress and American Idol finalist Katherine McPhee. MPAC, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, has been at the center of Morristown’s revitalization and is a major reason why it’s a nightlife hotspot today, with several wonderful bars and restaurants lining its lively streets since its inception, according to General Manager Ed Kirchdoerffer. “Twenty-five years ago, Morristown wasn’t the popular town it is now,” Kirchdoerffer, a Morristown native, said. “We feel the opening of the performing arts center was part of the rebuilding of Morristown. It’s been an anchor for improvement.” Top musical and comedic acts have performed at MPAC over the years, from Foreigner and Daughtry to Melissa Ethridge and Wayne Brady, and every great entertainer in between. Moreover, MPAC doesn’t have any plans of slowing down any time soon. Musical performers such as America, Kenny G, Joan Jett and the Blackhearts and Ruben Studdard will be hitting the stage in October. “We feel we’re still in a growth cycle,” Kirchdoerffer said. “We constantly challenge ourselves to grow and invest in ourselves to make the best possible events.”  Kirchdoerffer said some of the ways MPAC will be celebrating its 25 years in Morristown are by holding a few free concerts, ask its performance-goers, on social media, to name their favorite moments since its opening, and have a number of $25 ticket offers, to name a few.  However, MPAC is more than a concert hall for some of today’s greatest acts. It also offers a Performing Arts School (PAS), founded in 2006, which now serves approximately 700 students per year with over 20 classes a week within a supportive and creative atmosphere. Students ages five to 18 come from all over Northern New Jersey to learn performance technique while building confidence and having a great time. Classes are offered in musical theatre, acting, singing technique, song presentation, improvisation, private voice and adult cabaret. “The emphasis isn’t placed on being a star,” Kirchdoerffer explained. “It’s placed on being part of a team, being part of the creative process. They really get a full immersive experience. Everyone’s so encouraging of everyone else.” While most of the kids don’t enter the entertainment world, Kirchdoerffer noted that they will gain valuable skills that will help them succeed in life. “Most won’t go on to become performers,” he said, “but they will learn important life skills that will go a long way, whether it’s in the boardroom or other areas of work.”Additionally, MPAC offers The Miracle Project, a fully inclusive music and theatre program for children with autism of all levels. “It’s been a very powerful program,” Kirchdoerffer said. “This is a program that grew organically. Many parents have spoken about (their experiences) and are happy to see their kids enjoy themselves. This (program) gives them a safe haven. They get to have fun while being themselves.” There’s also an Art Upstairs Gallery, located in the balcony lobby of MPAC, which showcases visual artists from a variety of disciplines, including watercolor, oils, photography, sculpture and more. Each year, the works of over 200 artists are showcased in group exhibits. Each display hangs from six to eight weeks.With all the success MPAC has experienced over the last 25 years, Kirchdoerffer said he hopes to see more prosperous years ahead for the Morristown institution, which has been a staple in the thriving town. “We have been here for 25 years and hope to do it for 25 more years and beyond,” he said. “It’s been the town’s heartbeat.” For more information on MPAC’s educational programs, Art Upstairs Gallery, and a list of upcoming performances, go to www.mayoarts.org. Mayo Performing Arts Center Celebrates 25 Years of Prosperity  added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "By Henry M. HoldenThe Morristown Festival of Books is an annual two-day event that takes place this year on October 11 and 12. According to Rachel Barry, Director of the Morristown Festival of Books, “The 6-year-old event is modeled after successful book festivals in other communities throughout the world. Each autumn, the festival brings together authors with readers and book lovers. The Festival is New Jersey’s premier book festival, celebrating the written word’s power to challenge, transport and transform.” Barry says the festival is growing each year. “We started with about 1,500 visitors six years ago and last year we hosted over 8,000.”The opening night is a ticketed Keynote Event featuring Preet Bharara who served as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York from 2009 to 2017. In 2017, Bharara joined the NYU School of Law faculty as a Distinguished Scholar in Residence. Bharara will speak on Friday evening at the Mayo Performing Arts Center at 7:30pm. Tickets will be available through the MPAC box office and on the festival website. Tickets are also available at the door on the night of the event, as availability allows.The Main Festival takes place all day on Saturday (10 a.m. – 5 p.m.), rain or shine.This year’s festival features more than 50 authors. Author selections featuring various genres are designed to appeal to a variety of ages and reading interests. “Authors will be speaking and answering questions in informal one-hour indoor sessions at five festival venues throughout the day,” said Barry. “Immediately following his or her talk, you will have the opportunity to speak with your favorite authors and have your books personalized at the Author Signing Tent, on the Vail Mansion lawn.” These sessions are free, no tickets required; general seating is on a first-come, first-served basis. There will also be portable restrooms at the Vail Mansion lawn. “The Festival center is on the lawn in front of the historic Vail Mansion (110 South Street), where there is an Information Tent, a Book Tent selling copies of the visiting authors’ books, the Signing Tent where authors will greet visitors and sign books, and concession stands selling refreshments.”“This year’s closing event is an exciting interactive event called Pitchapalooza,” said Barry. “It’s like American Idol for books (only without Simon). Anyone with an idea for a book has the chance to pitch it to a panel of judges. But they get only one minute.”The hosts, Arielle Eckstut and David Henry Sterry (a.k.a. The Book Doctors) team up with guest industry insiders to form the judging panel. The Judges critique everything from idea to style to potential in the marketplace and much more. Whether potential authors pitch themselves, or simply listen to trained professionals critique each presentation, Pitchapaloozas are educational and entertaining for all. All attendees come away with concrete advice on how to improve their pitch as well as a greater understanding of the ins and outs of the publishing industry.At the end of each Pitchapalooza, the judges come together to pick a winner. That winner receives an introduction by Eckstut and Sterry to an agent or publisher who is appropriate for their work. The Festival audience will also have a chance to pick a winning pitch. That Audience Choice winner will be voted on by the audience and will receive a 30-minute phone consultation from Eckstut and Sterry (a $150 value).KidFest @ MFOB includes author talks, signings, and fun activities all day for children up to 12 years old. Additionally, concessions will be available in the KidFest outdoor area outside the Presbyterian Church Parish House at 65 South Street. Please note, the festival is not held on the Morristown Green. There are several public parking garages within walking distance of the Festival center. This is a casual event. Wear comfortable walking shoes and be prepared for cool weather. It is a rain or shine event, so please bring an umbrella if the day’s weather warrants it. For more information and a list of authors attending see: www.morristownbooks.orgThe Morristown Festival of Books is Back added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "By: Michele DiPasquale To some, a library may be a thing of the past; but in fact, libraries are currently visited much more frequently than one might think. And public libraries can still proclaim that they are not only crucial to the populace for offering the enjoyment of reading for free, but for the very relevant and contemporary services they provide. In fact, a recent survey showed that, since 2016, 53% of Millennials say they used a library at least twice in any given year, and that number is actually higher when comparing it to 45% of Gen Xers and 43% of Baby Boomers who were simultaneously polled. So even in today’s online world, the public library is still absolutely in demand. Catherine Tinger GoldbergThere are public libraries for children, adolescents, teens, and adults, but the very first library for your very young child, is, in fact, First Library® of Morristown. At First Library new mothers and parents can borrow books and other materials, make use of reference collections, enjoy computer services, and encourage early literacy and the joy of reading.  “The idea to start First Library® came to me after my friend, Diane, had her first child. I wanted to give my love of reading to her and her newborn, so I sent her some books to read to her baby son, Lubin. Diane later explained that she was having a hard time finding English-language children’s books to read to him and that my books were the perfect gift for a new first-time mother (from the United States living in France). So I began sending her a new children’s book every month – many were childhood favorites of my own children. Diane would call or write to say how she, and later her son, happily anticipated the arrival of their monthly book and the joy they received reading it together, and how they both looked forward to reading time,” shared Catherine Tinger Goldberg, founder and director of First Library®. She felt that if a book could bring so much happiness, joy, and comfort to just one child, how much could it bring to multiple children? It was then that she decided to create First Library®. By taking a cue from Dolly Parton and her Imagination Library program, Ms. Tinger Goldberg followed Ms. Parton’s idea. The Imagination Library was created in 1995 for in-need children in Ms. Parton’s native Tennessee. The purpose was and is for each child, regardless of gender, race, or income, to register at the Imagination Library program and receive a free book each month until the age of five, paid for by Ms. Parton’s Dollywood Foundation®. While it began for children in need in Tennessee, Ms. Parton, by the year 2000, allowed and promoted the replication of the program to other states.  In order to promote local library patronage, First Library® became more than a free monthly book program. Ms. Tinger Goldberg devised a curriculum for first-time mothers in need that was tailored to their and their firstborn child’s special circumstances. The curriculum would give first-time parents in need the First Library® book program (or other books) and gently-used clothing and educational toys during their child’s first three years of life, free of charge, by requiring parents to read to their child daily and submit a reading log each month.  First Library promotes regular local library patronage and does not operate its own private, first-time mothers only, library facility.\n",
      " All requested library activities are to be performed at the first time mother’s home library. Also, although the three programs, First Library, More First Library and Most First Library are similar but differentiate themselves in the amount of activities required, all of the items we offer for selection by the mothers, except for the previously chosen new Imagination Library books, are brand new, not gently used. “All we ask is that parents read to their child daily and maintain regular library patronage,” Ms. Tinger Goldberg explained.  “Essentially we are a free book program but sometimes more than a book a month is necessary to bring the importance of regular reading and books into a home. For children born under the poverty level there are new educational toys and clothing available for the parents,” Ms. Tinger Goldberg said. “I feel it is so important for children to be read to early and consistently. Children should have a firm foundation for a lifetime love of reading, respect for literature, and an appreciation for all things the library has to offer. I hope I am achieving these goals with First Library®,” Ms. Tinger Goldberg explained. Because First Library is in five counties and growing throughout the State of New Jersey, aside from receptions at their offices, they rely on individual community members and Community Actions teams to spread the word about First Library’s mission and fundraising efforts. They do accept monetary donations on behalf of the donor’s community through Classy.org. First Library is also an approved charity of the AmazonSmile program. “What parents and other community members are starting to realize is that if we help all children, whether they are less fortunate or not, learn to read early and on a consistent basis, we are helping everyone in their class, school, and community,” she shared. First Library is available in Livingston, Carteret, Edison, North Brunswick, Port Reading, Sewaren, Perrineville, Cedar Knolls, Chatham Borough, Chatham Township, Green Village, Morristown, New Vernon, Whippany, Somerset, and Basking Ridge.  First Library Will Help Build Libraries of Babies added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "How To Combat Cold And Flu(NAPSI)—According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), chances are good you’ll get a cold or the flu this year. Adults have an average of two to three colds per year and children have even more, while 5 to 20 percent of the population gets the flu. Fortunately, there are steps you can take to minimize your risk and ease your symptoms.Consider these tips from Chloraseptic® pharmacist spokesperson Maria Mantione:• Get a flu shot. The CDC recommends a flu shot for everyone over the age of 6 months. It’s easy to get—just talk to your pharmacist. It’s the best way to prevent the spread of the flu. It does not prevent the common cold, but the flu is a devastating, serious illness that could put you out of commission for a week or more or, even worse, land you in the hospital with pneumonia or infect someone you love with a weaker immune system—such as babies, the elderly or those undergoing chemotherapy.• Wash your hands often. Washing your hands with soap and water is the best way to prevent the spread of the common cold.• Prevent illness by practicing healthy habits. Make sure to get enough sleep, eat a balanced, nutritious diet, exercise and minimize stress.• If you do get sick, talk to your pharmacist about how to manage your symptoms with medications. Before cold season, stock your medicine cabinet with the essentials. Stick to single-ingredient products, so you have what you need to treat your specific symptoms. These include pain relievers and fever reducers, a decongestant, cough medicine, lozenges and a sore throat spray. Topical medications, such as Chloraseptic sore throat sprays and lozenges, are great to have on hand because they’re portable, can be used safely with other cold medicines and have very few side effects.In fact, Chloraseptic is the No. 1 sore throat relief brand around. It provides fast-acting relief for sore throats and mouth pain to help you get through your day.From lozenges that soothe nasal passages and suppress coughs to sprays that target pain when and where it hurts, there’s a broad portfolio of products based on your preferences and needs.The lozenges have a soothing liquid center that relieves pain and cools nasal passages. MAX Wild Berry is the strongest throat relief lozenge in the line. Chloraseptic Total offers a multisymptom lozenge formula that can suppress your cough for up to four hours.Chloraseptic’s sprays are the No. 1 pharmacist-recommended brand. The new and improved Cherry Spray tastes great, works on contact and is free of aspirin, sugar and gluten. The MAX Wild Berry Targeted Throat Spray is convenient for travel or to keep in your purse. The targeted spray makes it easier when you’re on the go to coat and protect specific areas in your mouth and throat. All these products are available at mass retailers, major drugstores and grocery stores.Also helping to keep you ahead of the flu this season is an online Cold + Flu tracker. To check for outbreaks and symptoms, go to www.chloraseptic.com, click on Cold + Flu Tracker and enter your zip code.How To Combat Cold And Flu added by new_view_media on December 22, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Helping Older People to Maintain Independence(NAPSI)—For most older adults, the ability to live independently is associated with the ability to drive. That’s one reason the prospect of eventually “giving up the keys” can be a frightening one.To help, the experts on aging at the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging (n4a) developed a brochure called “Before You Give Up the Keys: Create a Roadmap for Transportation Independence” that may lessen those fears by empowering older adults to evaluate their mobility needs, identify the transportation options in their community and develop a plan customized to their unique circumstances.“A too-familiar scenario is that older adults wait until they’re involved in some sort of emergency, like a traffic accident, before they really think about their driving ability and the other transportation options available to them in their community,” said n4a CEO Sandy Markwood. “Our goal is to shed light on a critical issue that will likely affect most families with an older loved one who may need to limit or eliminate their driving, and to provide a catalyst for discussion, and hopefully, action,” Markwood also noted.The n4a represents America’s national network of 623 Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs). It helps older adults and people with disabilities live with dignity and choices in their homes and communities for as long as possible.To that end, it created the Eldercare Locator. This serves as an essential, trusted gateway to help older adults, caregivers and health professionals navigate the maze of aging programs and services, as well as to assist them in identifying and accessing the resources that match their needs best. The National Call Center operates five days a week from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET and can be reached at 800-677-1116 or www.eldercare.gov.According to recent research by the Federal Transit Administration, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, n4a and the National Aging and Disability Transportation Center, the rise in the 65-plus population—some 45 million and growing—has triggered a corresponding spike in the number of nondrivers of more than 1.1 million between 2001 and 2009.“This is a major issue for older adults because when they lack access to transportation, they can’t get to the doctor, the grocery store or see friends and family as much, which means their overall well-being is likely to suffer,” added Kathy Greenlee, Assistant Secretary for Aging.Free BrochureTo download the free brochure, go to www.n4a.org/files/ResourcesforOlderAdults.pdf.

      "Protect Your Health, Protect Your Toothbrush(NAPSI)—Did you know that keeping your toothbrush clean is a simple way to help protect your health and the health of your loved ones year-round, and especially during flu season?Dentists’ Advice for the Entire FamilyAccording to pediatric dentist Danielle Gilbert-Fowler, D.M.D., “Oral health is not just about your mouth, it’s about your overall health. The mouth is a major doorway for all sorts of microorganisms, which can be linked to anything from the common cold to heart disease and diabetes. Hence, the importance of having a healthy mouth cannot be overstated.”“More than 300 kinds of microorganisms thrive in the human mouth,” explains Astrid Shroetter, D.D.S. “What’s more, the typical toothbrush is reused for months and never cleaned thoroughly.”Research indicates that kids get sick on average about 10 times a year—that’s almost once a month. While dentists and parents both encourage good oral hygiene, it would be nice to do so without worrying about potential reinfection caused by brushing teeth with contaminated toothbrushes. As Dr. Gilbert-Fowler puts it, “You wouldn’t clean your house with a dirty washcloth. Why clean your teeth with a dirty toothbrush?”A Solution“It’s important to keep toothbrushes in a clean environment and separate from other toothbrushes,” recommends Gilbert-Fowler. “Use of a Steripod® clip-on toothbrush protector will help keep your toothbrush clean and protect against outside contaminants and cross contamination from other toothbrushes. It’s important for kids and adults alike to replace toothbrushes every three months or more frequently after any illness.”Developed by doctors and independently tested for efficacy at an accredited lab, Steripod is a clip-on protector that fits any standard or electric toothbrush. Using a patented natural vapor shield of thymol, derived from the thyme plant, Steripod keeps toothbrushes fresh and clean for up to three months. Simply clip it on your electric or manual toothbrush and it goes to work; no cables or batteries are needed. You can use it at home, work, the gym, school or when you travel.More Pearls of Wisdom for Your Pearly Whites:To further put the bite on dental disease, heed these five tips from the experts at the American Dental Association:1. Brush your teeth twice a day for two minutes with a soft-bristled brush.2. Replace your toothbrush every three or four months, or if the bristles are frayed.3. Use an ADA-accepted fluoride toothpaste.4. Clean between teeth daily with floss.5. Visit your dentist regularly for professional cleanings and oral exams.Learn MoreVisit www.GetSteripod.com or call (310) 204-7880.Protect Your Health, Protect Your Toothbrush added by new_view_media on December 22, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "6 Tips for Planning Your Wedding Photos Like a Pro\n",
      "Five words or less(NewsUSA) – With everything that goes into your wedding day, those once-in-a-lifetime moments will go by in a blur, which is why hiring a professional wedding photographer is a must. After all, the last thing you should be worrying about is whether your photographer will be able to capture your big day.\n",
      "The key? Prepare yourself so that you can accurately evaluate the “right” photographer for you.\n",
      "“The best photographer will take the time to build a rapport with you and use his or her experience and creativity to capture the mood, personality, ambiance and even the geography of your wedding,” says PPA (Professional Photographers of America) photographer Berit Bizjak. “The finest wedding photography is more than a series of still pictures. It’s physical poetry — it tells the story of the day and portrays the essence of both people and place.”\n",
      "To this end, PPA, the largest international nonprofit association created by professional photographers, has taken the guesswork out of the process by offering six tips to help you plan your wedding photos like a pro:\n",
      "1. Book far in advance. The best photographers get booked quickly — sometimes as much as a year in advance — so don’t wait until the last minute to book your photographer.\n",
      "2. Show them the money. Now is not the time to skimp on your photo budget. Call around and get a price range for services, and remember: after the cake is long gone, and the dress is stored away, your wedding photos will be the only things left to share and enjoy for years to come, so don’t cut too many corners on your photography budget — you’ll end up regretting it.\n",
      "3. Make sure your photographer is a real pro. Only hire someone who has liability insurance, experience taking the style of photos you want, backup equipment and a plan for when things go south. Ideally, he or she is a PPA photographer. PPA photographers do more than just snap pictures. They have the technical expertise and artistry to make you look your best and bring your vision to life. They also abide by a strict code of ethics that makes a real difference. Watch this (video) to see real married couples share their stories.\n",
      "4. Request to see a full gallery of real weddings. Look at full wedding coverage (not just a small selection of each wedding’s best moments) to see a photographer’s true style and get a sense of how he or she might tell your “story.” Do you prefer more artistic or traditional poses? Would you rather have a photojournalist approach or a mix of all styles?\n",
      "5.Work with your photographer to create a detailed shot list. PPA wedding photographers can also help you create that shot list, as they know what key moments tell a wedding story and can prepare for those. But talk about your must-haves, and walk through the entire program with your photographer ahead of time. Share your expectations ahead of time to ensure that he or she captures the key shots, while remaining attentive and available to catch the best candid moments.\n",
      "6. Plan your post-wedding photo strategy• ahead of time! Almost as soon as the festivities are over, you’ll be eager to look at the photos so you can relive your big day over and over again. Ask your photographer for teasers or a “sneak peek” and a timeline for when the rest of the pictures will be available.

      "Wedding Gifts for Grooms: A Tradition Brides Shouldn’t Ignore\n",
      "Five words or less(NewsUSA) – The answer is: Yes, it’s expected.\n",
      "But it’s also a chance for all you brides out there to truly show you know that not everything is about you on your wedding day. That there really is another person involved (that would be the groom) who deserves a bit of recognition, too.\n",
      "We’re talking wedding presents — specifically, yours to your husband-to-be.\n",
      "Tradition does, indeed, hold that both you and he exchange gifts. And while it’s true that some guys are initially shocked to learn your engagement ring doesn’t also count as a “present,” that’s no excuse for you to waver.\n",
      "“Giving him something that’s just for him will make him feel really special,” advises BrideBox.com.\n",
      "Here’s what you need to know now that it’s prime time for weddings:\n",
      "* When to exchange them. Etiquette dictates that the hand-off occurs at one of three times: the night before the wedding, the morning of the ceremony, or right before leaving on your honeymoon. Think it’s bad luck to see the groom before the nuptials? “Many couples choose to courier gifts via bridesmaids or groomsmen just before the ceremony,” says Brides.com.\n",
      "* There’s a thin line between “romantic” and “mushy.” Some of you may be tempted to compile a “love notes” journal of every bit of correspondence you’ve ever sent your groom. Even assuming he’s the type who wouldn’t consider that a bit “over the top,” there’s always the chance he might be left wondering, “Okay, where’s my real present?”– especially if his gift to you is a serious piece of jewelry.\n",
      "* The consensus choice. There’s a reason a watch invariably makes everyone’s short list: It’s the perfect statement of who he is or aspires to be. (It’s also a lot more impressive than a flask, which for some reason also gets a few votes).\n",
      "No less a taste arbiter than MarthaStewartWeddings.com favors Baume & Mercier’s Clifton line — as elegant as the original 1950s model that inspired it — for the way it “easily transitions from big day to every day.” Like the Swiss watchmaker’s timelessly charming (and affordably luxurious) Classima line, it comes with a choice of straps, dial faces and a variety of what’s known as “small complications” that go way beyong just telling the hour. You can shop them at the Baume & Mercier e-boutique or by calling 1-800-MERCIER, where free engraving and wrapping are available.\n",
      "* Fun fact. One writer at AskMen.com says he’s “heard of women giving their husbands watches in the ceremony instead of a wedding ring.” If so, the answer is: No, just like your engagement ring, that wouldn’t also qualify as a wedding present.Wedding Gifts for Grooms: A Tradition Brides Shouldn’t Ignore added by new_view_media on December 22, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "WeddingDollarsCYou can thank Kim Kardashian and Kanye West for setting the bar so high when it comes to getting married.The average cost of a wedding — sans a honeymoon — has now soared to more than $31,000, according to the wedding planning website TheKnot. And experts say the “images of celebrity wedding extravagance,” a la last year’s $12 million “Kimye” nuptials in Florence, Italy, are influencing couples’ spending choices.Another reason for the jump, experts say, are the engagement rings.“People want big rings like the ones celebrities wear,” says Jason Kordvani, president of product development at Davani (davanijewelry.com), a family-owned company specializing in colored gemstones that has an almost 50-year reputation for creating some of the most gorgeous engagement rings around.Obviously, you don’t have to shell out that much to have the wedding of your dreams. But with this being the prime time for popping the question — 39 percent of all marriage proposals occur between Thanksgiving and Valentine’s Day — there is one trend that’s become both a must and a potential money-saving opportunity.Personalization, experts say, is on the rise.Here’s what we mean:• The engagement ring. If you’ve been reading the glossies, you know that celebs like Elizabeth Hurley and Jessica Simpson are breaking from tradition and wearing engagement rings with colored gemstones. Not only does this take fashion to a whole new level, but colored gemstones have also become a way to customize an engagement ring. And while it needn’t be her birthstone — Simpson’s is ruby, but Hurley’s sapphire jibes with the month her then-fiance was born — the right romantic touch can make for the ultimate in personalization.“It can also be the month a couple met or her favorite color,” says Kordvani.Whether sapphire, emerald, ruby or some other stone, Kordvani notes, couples are also often pleasantly surprised to discover they can get a “larger, more important-looking ring at much less cost than a diamond.” Davani Jewelry itself offers styles ranging from the more affordable Davani Bridal to the show-stopping Luxury Collection.• The reception. The bad news here is that spending on cocktail hours jumped 7 percent. So think signature cocktails rather than an open bar.• The wedding venue. “When couples get married, they’re really looking for interesting, unusual details,” Lorin Holmes, co-founder of VermontWeddings.com told USA Today. All things considered, the $50,000 price tag to hold a reception at the New York Public Library— anything cultural or historic is also hot — makes the average venue booking fee of $14,000 a little less jaw dropping.For more information, visit www.davanijewelry.com.The Many Colors of Love: Engagement Rings Get a Makeover added by new_view_media on December 22, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Want to Increase Revenue? Take Your Business Global(NAPSI)—International selling may seem daunting, but thanks to the Internet, it’s more attainable than ever. With the right tools in place, small businesses can go global and increase revenues without the headache.The question then is, “Where should I sell?” Consider these two destinations as you map out your plan for international growth:CanadaCanadians are e-commerce enthusiasts—in fact, 60 percent of Canada’s online shoppers buy from U.S.-based sellers. As an added bonus, there’s typically no language barrier for U.S. businesses selling into Canada.Given this opportunity for U.S. small businesses, the U.S. Postal Service opted to create zone-based pricing for all Priority Mail International® shipments headed to Canada starting on May 31, 2015.This means that the USPS will charge for shipping based on the U.S. origin ZIP code and the Canada destination postal code, instead of blending expensive routes into one flat rate.There will now be seven pricing zones for shipping. Some rates will increase, but for businesses in major cities—such as San Francisco, Miami and Chicago—savings will be around $8 per package.BrazilLatin America is the world’s second-fastest-growing e-commerce market, and leading this boom is Brazil. With 202 million citizens, of whom 33.5 million shop online, Brazil presents a huge opportunity for U.S.-based businesses looking to expand, though it’s not without its challenges.Due to delays in customs clearance, postal packages could take up to 20 days to arrive. Duties and taxes, as well as complicated custom forms, slow the process for both U.S. merchants and the buyers.However, there are solutions. Shipping technology company Endicia just launched a program called Endicia Global Service, which allows shipments from U.S. businesses to reach Brazilian customers in as little as 8 days. Additionally, duties and taxes can be paid by the buyer up front, and there are no complicated customs forms to fill out.“International selling is a great way to grow a business and secure additional revenue,” said Endicia co-founder and general manager Amine Khechfé. “These markets in particular are undergoing massive growth, and there’s never been a better time for small businesses to look into them.”To learn about the tools you need to succeed in going global, check out www.endicia.com/go-global.Want to Increase Revenue?

      "(BPT) – Remember free time? You used to have so much of it. But these days, work and family obligations have you running around constantly and you don’t know what to do first. You don’t even have time to do everything you have to do, let alone what you want to do.So how do you take back your day? How do you find the time to get things done and bring back some semblance of order? It is possible if you focus on making yourself more efficient. To help you accomplish all of your goals and find some free time as well, here are four ways you can improve your efficiency every single day.* Make a plan. When you’re running through your list of daily obligations the morning of, it’s easy to forget a thing or two, especially if you have children running around, phones ringing or dogs barking to distract you. Instead, plan out the upcoming day the night before. Make a list of everything you have to do and check these items against one another. Can two trips be combined? Are you prioritizing the most important things first? The better you can plan out your schedule, the more organized you’ll be the next day.* Get the news and information you need ASAP. You are bombarded by digital content every day and some of it is really important – but who has time to sift through it all? To help you find the information you need as quickly as possible, Fresly LLC launched a new app, iNews Photo. Whether you are on the go, or gathering news in your office this application allows you access to global and local news curated in real time by former journalist directly to your mobile phone or on a larger screen.* Set priorities. You don’t have time to do it all and maybe you don’t have to. Sit down and make a list of every social or professional group and obligation you belong to. Once you’ve made the list, look at it and ask yourself honestly how important this obligation is to you or your family. If you find the obligation is not essential, you’re better off to abandon it and save your time for the responsibilities that are more important to you.* Limit multitasking. Many people look to multitasking as an efficiency solution, but doing several things at once means it takes longer to accomplish any one task. And when the first task is completed, the result is often poorer because of it. Instead of trying to do several things at once, focus on the most important thing, accomplish it and move on.With today’s hectic schedules, finding the opportunity to do everything you’re supposed to do may seem impossible. However, if you apply the four tips listed above, you’ll improve your efficiency, stay up on the latest news and maybe even discover that elusive free time you sorely deserve.

      "medical workers working together in hospital(BPT) – Over the last decade, a number of changes have transformed the healthcare industry. The Affordable Care Act has enabled more than 16.4 million Americans to receive healthcare coverage. Advancements in technology improve both diagnoses and treatment quality. Retail health offers a convenience used by more than 10 million patients at 1,800 retail health locations. Along with the current challenges facing the healthcare system, such as an aging population, increased patient volume and physician shortages, these changes prompt the expansion of the traditional role of a nurse.Generally, Americans believe nurses’ roles are expanding as they share increased responsibilities to support the delivery of high quality healthcare, according to a poll commissioned by University of Phoenix College of Health Professions. The survey also found that adults in the United States view their experience with nurses as overwhelmingly positive. In fact, 95 percent found nurses to be a valuable addition to the healthcare system as a whole, and 87 percent view nurses as trusted sources of health information.“As nurses take on greater responsibility, and as the needs of healthcare organizations continue to grow more complex, the skills and training requirements of nurses must be prepared to match this growth,” says Betty Nelson, Ph.D., RN, and academic dean for University of Phoenix School of Nursing. “This is especially important given that the United States is currently facing a shortage of as many as 90,000 physicians by 2025.. Nurses with advanced education can help fill this shortage, particularly in areas where consumers do not have access to care.”Because of this, employers are looking for nurses with a variety of skills and certifications including:* Additional degrees or seeking an advanced degree* In-demand skills such as bilingualism, leadership and critical thinking* Flexibility and professionalism* The desire to grow into advanced practitioners such as nurse practitioners and physician assistants* Specialized training for working with various populations* An openness to diverse opportunities in a number of different facilitiesIn order to keep up with the changes in the healthcare system, at least 80 percent of the nation’s nursing workforce will need a bachelor’s degree by 2020 and the number of nurses with doctoral degrees will need to be double, according to the Institute of Medicine. Nursing education institutions play a critical role in meeting the needs of today’s healthcare system. Nurses need a place to obtain these degrees and further their skills within the healthcare industry. Institutions recognize the expanding role of the 21st century nurse and are offering a wide range of curriculum and degree programs that address recent changes in the delivery of primary care. Graduates need to be equipped with the skills they need to succeed in today’s health care market.It’s now more important than ever that nurses have the training and skills to match the demands of the growing profession. Along with the nursing community, institutions that offer nursing degree programs must work together to enhance and better prepare the nursing workforce.What employers look for in the 21st century nurse added by new_view_media on November 15, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "(BPT) – What image does the word “grilling” bring to mind? Do you envision thick, juicy burgers or steaks? What about sauce-slathered chicken breasts sizzling over coals? Cooking out is one of the great joys of warm weather, but if you leave side dishes out of your grilling plans – or stick with cold sides like salads – you’re missing out on some great flavors.Side dishes give you a chance to really show off your grilling chops, savor the farm fresh flavors of summer harvests, and indulge in wholesome, organic fare. Here are six summer side dishes that go great on the grill:1. Corn on the cob – If you’ve always wanted to try grilling vegetables but weren’t sure which of your favorites would go well on the grill – take heart! Virtually any veggie can be prepared on a grill, but corn becomes a show-stopper when grilled. Remove the husks and silk and toss the cobs right on a preheated grill. Watch them careful and keep turning them to ensure they brown but don’t burn. The heat from the grill causes the natural sugars in the corn to carmelize, and you’ll end up with the sweetest sweet corn you ever tasted!2. Fries – A trip to the grocery store or farmer’s market for fresh produce may not fit in your schedule if you’re grilling on the fly. There’s good news – frozen options like Alexia Organic Oven Crinkles with Sea Saltdeliver farm to flavor taste when prepared on the grill or in the oven. Made from Pacific Northwest russet potatoes, Alexia’s organic fries are sprinkled with bright sea salt to bring out even more of the rich flavor that Mother Nature delivered. Make a tray out of aluminum foil, spread the Oven Crinkles in a single layer, and grill for about 20-25 minutes at 400-450 degrees F. Turn once or twice during the cooking process.3. Tomatoes – If you’ve only grilled small tomatoes on a kabob, or never tried grilled tomatoes at all, this is your summer to discover grilling tomatoes couldn’t be easier. Start with large, meaty tomatoes – a variety that’s dense and has fewer seeds works best. Slice in half, brush with your favorite seasoned oil and place the halves cut-side down on the grill. Cook for 3-5 minutes on each side. Top with your favorite cheese when done.4. Kale – Grilling greens like kale helps all those wonderful nutrients and flavor stay in the vegetable and don’t disappear into the cooking water – which is what can happen when you boil veggies on the stovetop. Grilling kale couldn’t be easier. You can adapt virtually any of your favorite kale recipes to grilling by tossing the kale with the recipe seasonings and some oil. Arrange the seasoned leaves in a single layer on the grill and they’ll cook to crispy splendor in just minutes.5. Cheese – A slice of gooey melted cheese is the crowning glory atop your grilled burger, but cheese can also handle the grill on its own, and be a delicious, different side dish or appetizer. Many cheeses will work on the grill, and you can find recommendations for the best cheeses to cook on the grill with a simple online search. Slice your chosen cheese in thick pieces. Most grilling cheeses will need minimal seasoning and little or no oil. Generally, cheese takes just a minute or two to brown each side and allow the inside to melt.6. Dinner rolls – Craving dinner rolls to go with that thick juicy steak, but in no mood to fire up the oven when it’s 90 degrees outside? You can make frozen dinner rolls on the grill. Choose your favorite variety, such as Alexia Artisan French Rolls or Artisan Focaccia Rolls, set your gas grill to the temperature recommended on the package’s directions, wrap the rolls in foil and place directly on the grill. Keep an eye on the rolls to ensure they don’t burn as they can cook quickly on a grill.6 summer sides you never knew you could grill added by new_view_media on April 3, 2016View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "(BPT) – Traditional wedding rules have fallen by the wayside – food trucks are in, having a hashtag is a must, bridesmaids no longer wear the same dress and groomsmen are sometimes in sneakers. Couples are actively seeking ways to differentiate themselves and get creative. All that aside, there is one thing that remains constant – weddings must have wine.Without wine, there is no glass to raise during the toast to the bride and groom and nothing to drink when the bar closes during dinner. Wine is the first thing guests are offered when they take a seat, and – you know that they say – it’s important to make a good first impression.Choosing the right varietals for your wedding does not have to be a stressful endeavor. Whether you’re a novice wine drinker or a connoisseur, follow these four tips and you’ll please a crowd without spending a fortune:Say “cheers!” with a sparkling wine.People love a good toast, and nothing washes down a teary maid of honor speech like a glass of sparkling. Riondo Prosecco is an accessible option that’s ideal to enjoy any day of the year, but perfectly suited for special occasions. You’ll get six pours out of a bottle, so plan accordingly!Good things come in threes.In addition to a sparkling, you’ll want a red and a white option that are familiar and food-friendly. You can’t go wrong with a Merlot – look for labels from the Napa region. For a white, Terlato Friuli Pinot Grigio is exceptional and ideal for food pairing.Wine math: What you didn’t learn in school.Running out of wine mid-wedding isn’t an option, so it’s important to do the math. You should anticipate getting about 5 glasses per bottle and assume that each guest will drink one glass per hour. Follow this rule and the wine will flow all night long, keeping you and your guests happy.Don’t break the bank, but stay away from the cheap stuff.Choosing an excellent wine doesn’t mean paying top-dollar, but buying too cheap can mean sacrificing quality. There are countless high-quality, delicious, wines available for $10-$20 per bottle, so leave the cheap stuff on the bottom shelf!4 wine buying tips for weddings added by new_view_media on April 3, 2016View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "(BPT) – Around-the-clock food shows, celebrity guests and niche themed restaurants are just a few reasons the fine food movement continues to experience extraordinary growth. In 2016, more people will be seeking upscale dining experiences that focus on the unique to the luxurious — and they’re willing to pay big bucks to do so.In fact, Americans said they would splurge an average of $203 in order to have a once-in-a-lifetime dining experience at a gourmet restaurant, according to a recent online survey by Harris Poll sponsored byMichelin, the global tire maker that publishes the popular restaurant guide.What’s surprising is the people willing to pay the most for fine dining experiences are younger generations. Millennials (ages 18-34) on average would pay $282 for this culinary experience, compared to diners ages 45-54 who would shell out $170, and $122 for those 65 and older.One explanation for why younger diners are willing to pay so much is that they want to enjoy more than just fine cuisine. Many restaurants offer an overall experience that will be remembered long after the last morsel of food is gone. Whether it’s an incredible atmosphere, the opportunity to observe the chef work or gaining access to foods and cooking styles never available before, this desire for an experience is driving younger diners to invest in upscale dining.As America looks at the most recent Michelin star ratings to navigate the nation’s best eateries, there are some food and restaurant trends that are positioned to grow in 2016. Chefs will continue to expand their creative prowess by experimenting with new cooking styles and food fusions. Cooking methods will blend with science and art to create uniquely fine fare with a story that is as intriguing as the taste.Diversity is another notable trend for 2016. Authentic ethnic cuisine is in high demand and restaurants are answering the call. Traditional restaurants will begin to offer diverse plates in addition to timeless favorites to appeal to a wide range of palates. Expect to see more ancient grains, ethnic spices and worldly condiments at eateries in the future.Conscious dining is a growing trend thanks to diners’ increasing awareness of where their food comes from. Hyper-local sourcing of ingredients is being adopted by many notable restaurants. This includes growing fresh herbs and vegetables onsite and partnering with local farms for incredibly fresh dairy and meat products. Sustainable seafood partnerships are another effort by restaurants that supports the increasing demand for responsible dining options.Finally, diners are seeking chefs with the best reputation for tried-and-true favorites. That means the city’s chef with a reputation for curating and cooking the best steak will have a wait list. Supporting this nod toward the traditional, the Michelin survey found a quarter of U.S. adults say steakhouse cuisine is their favorite choice for dining. What’s the runner up? Italian ranked as the second choice nationally for the meal of a lifetime.Which 2016 dining trend do you want to try most? added by new_view_media on April 3, 2016View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "(BPT) – Snacks, produce, drinks or sweets – if it is a seasonal offering, Americans are anxiously awaiting it. According to Nielsen, Americans spend about $374 billion annually on snack foods. For many of those snack lovers, items that are only available for a limited time are one of the major highlights of seasonal occasions and holidays, especially this time of year when, according to a recent Cheetos brand survey, 65 percent of Americans profess their love of seasonal Easter treats.Whether your favorite holiday arrives in spring, summer, winter or fall, seasonal treats can sweeten your enjoyment of the season. No one wants to miss the coveted special flavors and offerings that appear on store shelves for short stints and are quickly cleared out by that clever “seasonal snack stockpiler” who is always one step ahead of you. So here’s your guide to the top treats to watch for this spring, and throughout the year.SpringIt might still be too chilly to feel like spring in some areas of the country, but St. Patrick’s Day undoubtedly marks the start of the springtime snacking season. Milkshake lovers will kick things off with mint-green milkshakes, and quickly turn their attention to Easter candies and snacks.Chocolate and marshmallow sweets are the traditional stars of Easter baskets across the country – for both the young, and the young at heart. It is no surprise that 71 percent of parents who celebrate Easter admit to sneaking snacks from their kids’ baskets, according to the Cheetos survey.Of course, everyone is familiar with jelly beans, peanut butter eggs, chocolate bunnies and marshmallow chicks, but the majority of consumers say they desire more variety beyond just candy. This year, there’s a new must-try alternative to satisfy the search for something beyond the candy animal monotony. Cheetos Sweetos, the cinnamon-sugar version of everyone’s favorite cheddar cheese snacks is reappearing in stores — and Easter baskets — this spring, but only for a limited time. Launched in 2015, Sweetos snacks are the perfect, and delicious, twist on Easter snacking.SummerFrozen treats are the highlight of summer, but not just the ice cream quarts you find year-round in the freezer cases at your local grocer. Summer means the ice cream truck will be rolling through neighborhood streets, sounding that familiar melodic “come and get it” tune and serving up frozen favorites that you just can’t find anywhere else —  or at any other time of year.You can’t go wrong with the missile-shaped, multi-colored ice pops that beckon from beside a myriad of fruit-flavored cream pops, or reliable favorites like ice cream sandwiches and chocolate-topped cones. And don’t forget snow cones — the refreshing shaved ice in perfect spheres mounted on a paper funnel and topped with your favorite sweet flavoring!FallOf course everyone knows fall is pumpkin season — and you should take every chance to enjoy all things pumpkin-flavored this time of year, from coffee and ice cream to bread, cake and pie.However, autumn also heralds state fair season across the country — and the arrival of a variety of innovative sweet treats that can only be enjoyed among the unique surroundings of fair rides, tickets and games. Funnel cakes are a state fair staple, and what could be better when the weather gets nippy than enjoying lightly sweetened, deep-fried dough dusted heavily with confectioner’s sugar? Depending on where you live in the country and which fair you attend, you can find over-the-top sweets and snacks such as deep-fried ice cream, fried candy bars and even pretzel-encrusted brownies deep-fried on a stick.WinterOf course, winter holidays are the pinnacle of seasonal snacking. From the final weeks of pumpkin season to the eggnog, candy canes and baked goods associated with holiday moments from Thanksgiving through New Year’s, winter serves up a buffet of food and snacks that are available at no other time of year.Winter’s arrival means anticipated delicacies like gingerbread-flavored everything, bite-sized candy favorites that marry mint and chocolate in holiday shapes, and of course the much-maligned and equally beloved fruit cake all hit store shelves just in time to make the holiday party circuit!Whatever your preference — savory, salty or sweet — make sure to enjoy these snacking staples throughout the year. But remember that seasonal treats come and go quickly, so be ready to grab a bag of Sweetos snacks, remember to listen for the ice cream truck’s playful tune, try your state’s delicacies and fill stockings with enough gingerbread cookies or mint-themed chocolate drops to last through the end of the year!Don’t miss these must-have snacks that define each season of the year added by new_view_media on April 3, 2016View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Be Well Tressed Every Day With Wigs(NAPSI)—Changing your hair to suit your hat, your mood or your outfit-or to make holidays and other celebrations that much more special—can be easier and more fun than ever.TV Star’s IdeaExplains Daytime Emmy Award winner Sherri Shepherd, “When I was a little girl, I would hear all this commotion in my house from my mom, aunts and grandmother when picking out their wigs for the day. It was such a good time for them and was a major part of their everyday beauty routines. Ever since then, I’ve watched the women in my household glow with confidence because they would customize their look day by day through the use of faux hair. My grandmother had a wig that she would pick out and wear perfectly with specific hats. My mother had an Angela Davis ‘power to the people’ wig. Watching these iconic women in my life pair their hair lengths, styles and colors with particular hats, outfits and personalities was exciting. Getting ready to go out was like an event in and of itself. Wigs are the perfect way for the inner diva in all women to come out and get creative, which is why I was inspired to start my own wig line to give women the choices to create their own style and look.“I always say, you were born with the hair you’ve got—now get the hair you want. Short and sassy, long and sexy or curly and fierce; you can easily change your hairstyle and transform your whole look to fit whatever your day brings. This is one of the reasons I wanted to create my line of wigs for Luxhair—I wanted to be able to give busy women high-quality, versatile looks to choose from that were simple and quick to put on but that were affordable and wouldn’t break their budget too.”The result is the Luxhair Now by Sherri Shepherd high-fashion wig and extension collection. “The collection provides the look you want, the style you want and the perfect accent to make a personal style statement, now.”Why WigsLike putting on your most stylish shoes and more powerful than a red lipstick, Shepherd says, these high-fashion styles can add some fabulous to your everyday. They can also be an excellent accessory to have during the holiday season when you want a party perfect ‘do but don’t want to spend a lot of time getting it. With a variety of lace front styles that give the appearance of natural hair growth, allow for styling away from the face and heat-friendly fiber, these wigs stand up to heat and humidity, offer styling options, and look, feel and move like real hair.What’s NewNow that Luxhair Now by Sherri Shepherd has partnered with national retailer Sally Beauty Supply, two new fun wig styles are available in over 1,900 stores nationwide.• Textured Pixie is a sassy pixie wig that features choppy texture for maximum volume and style along with precision-cut bangs that frame the face. It comes in medium dark brown, medium and light auburn and golden brown with auburn highlights.• The Feathered Pixie is a short, side-swept pixie with feathered texture and volume. It comes in medium dark brown and golden brown with auburn highlights.Each is made with revolutionary Luxhair Keralon heat-friendly synthetic fiber that looks and feels like real hair and can be heat styled up to 320° F.Learn MoreFor further facts, including where to find these wigs, go to www.sallybeauty.com and www.luxhair.com.Be Well Tressed Every Day With Wigs added by new_view_media on December 22, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "On National Senior Citizens Day, Three Ways To Celebrate The Older Generation(NAPSI)—Whether it’s your parents, grandparents, aunt, uncle or neighbor, you likely received guidance from or looked to older people in your life as you’ve tried to become more independent and deal with change and everyday challenges. August 21 is National Senior Citizens Day, and it’s an ideal time to honor seniors for the wisdom and care they have provided us, and also to celebrate the members of the older generation by finding ways to enhance their lives as they age.There’s No Place Like HomeNearly 90 percent of seniors want to age in place—stay in their own homes as they get older. But one out of three seniors suffers a fall each year, according to the CDC. Making an older person’s home as safe as possible is integral to helping him or her maintain this independence. Walking through seniors’ daily routine with them, from the time they get out of bed to when they go back to sleep, can reveal patterns in how they navigate their home and any potential hazards. By identifying the areas of concern and making necessary adjustments, you can decrease the risk of an accident and seniors can reside more confidently in their own home.Stay ConnectedTechnology now allows grandparents to FaceTime their children and grandchildren across the globe or even in the next town, and seniors to reconnect with classmates of decades past via Facebook. Older generations can create, build and maintain quality social relationships with the convenience and ease of social media. Seniors have a multitude of online outlets to share updates, photos and videos with loved ones. To help them stay in touch, ensure that the seniors in your life have reliable Internet connectivity, and help them set up social media accounts if they don’t have one already. In-person interaction is ideal, but keeping in touch through computers, tablets and smartphones is a great way to supplement seeing and speaking with each other.Everyone’s Wearing TechnologyWearable technology like the Apple Watch is popular among younger audiences, but wearable fitness trackers and medical alert devices can provide great benefits to seniors as well. In the event of a fall or accident where it’s impossible to get to a phone to call for help, a medical alert device immediately connects the injured to emergency services. Because that person’s medical history and health needs are on file, first responders can more easily treat them. With help a push of a button away, medical alert devices give seniors peace of mind even beyond health concerns. In fact, a recent survey by Bay Alarm Medical found that 80 percent of medical alert device wearers worry less when their adult children travel because they feel the device provides an adequate support system. If you decide to help protect the senior in your life with a wearable medical alert system, it’s also wise to look for a caring, people-first, ethical provider. Bay Alarm Medical, for example, implemented a Code of Ethics it follows for uncompromisingly ethical and transparent business practices. The company vows to prioritize customers over sales, make pricing publicly accessible and never pressure customers into a product or service they do not need, among other safeguards.National Senior Citizens Day is a day to commemorate the great ways in which seniors have helped us and we should show them how thankful we are every day. Simple steps such as a home safety walk-through, staying connected and providing the tools to enhance their physical and emotional well-being can go a long way in reducing the stress of aging for seniors and their loved ones.On National Senior Citizens Day, Three Ways To Celebrate The Older Generation added by new_view_media on December 24, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Don’t Let The Flu Mean Missing Memorable Moments(NAPSI)—While the cold and flu season often coincides with holiday celebrations and family get-togethers, there are preventative measures that families can take to stay healthy and not miss out.To help you get to the next “can’t miss” life event, consider these top preventative tips:• Get an annual flu shot. It’s the most effective way to help prevent the spread of influenza. For your convenience, you can get a vaccine at any of the more than 7,800 CVS/pharmacy and 900 MinuteClinic locations across the country. The flu shot is available every day with no appointment needed, including evenings and weekends.As a preventive service under the Affordable Care Act, it’s fully covered and available at no cost through most insurance plans, including Medicare Part B.The pharmacy can also be a one-stop shop for flu prevention resources, including over-the-counter cold and flu remedies, multivitamins and anti-bacterial cleaning products. Plus, anyone enrolled in the ExtraCare Rewards program gets a 20 percent off CVS Shopping Pass upon getting the flu shot in most places.• Seniors, take extra precaution. There’s a high-dose flu shot designed for those 65 and older, who have a greater risk of severe illness from the flu.• Plan ahead: the earlier, the better. It takes up to two weeks for your immunity to build up after getting a flu shot. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone who is at least 6 months old get a flu shot as soon as the vaccine is available.• Stay home if you’re ill. While it may seem like a no-brainer, two-thirds of employed Americans would still go to work even if they were feeling ill with flu-like symptoms. It’s important to understand the preliminary symptoms of the flu and, if you experience them, to stay home. This will help bolster your immune system and prevent the germs spreading.• Practice healthy habits. Door handles, desks and other everyday items are ridden with germs. Wash your hands frequently with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds and avoid touching your mouth and eyes. Additionally, eat nutritious foods, drink plenty of water, and get sufficient sleep to keep your immune system in top shape. Lead by example to educate children about these habits.Learn MoreFor further information and to find a nearby store, visit www.cvs.com/flu or download the CVS/pharmacy mobile app.Don’t Let The Flu Mean Missing Memorable Moments added by new_view_media on December 24, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Medicare Open Enrollment: What You Need To Knowby Patricia Smith(NAPSI)—Every year, millions of Medicare beneficiaries must decide which Medicare Advantage (MA) plan will best serve their needs. During Medicare’s annual open enrollment period, October 15-December 7, you can change MA plans or enroll in one for the first time. Important factors to consider include premium costs, choice of doctors and plan benefits. But there is one other important question: What is the quality rating of the plan?Quality is important because it means better health care and the best value for your money. Medicare uses a system called Star Ratings to assess the quality of plans, awarding plans from one to five stars. These ratings are based on many factors, such as how well the plan does in keeping people healthy and preventing illness, how quickly you can get an appointment and see specialists, and how the plan responds to your complaints and concerns.Today, 65 percent of MA enrollees are in plans with four stars or more, compared to 17 percent in 2009. Eight of the 12 MA plans earning five stars this year are members of the Alliance of Community Health Plans, an organization representing high-quality health plans.You can learn more about MA plans using the Medicare Plan Finder at www.Medicare.gov. The National Committee for Quality Assurance also evaluates quality in MA plans at www.ncqa.org.• Ms. Smith is the president and CEO of the Alliance of Community Health Plans, www.achp.org.Medicare Open Enrollment: What You Need To Know added by new_view_media on December 24, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Triple Sorghum Granola(Family Features) As you look to the new year with plans for healthier habits, there’s no better place to start than the beginning – the beginning of each day, that is. Countless studies have shown the benefits of a nutritious breakfast as part of a healthy eating plan, and there are plenty of options to make a good-for-you breakfast that tastes great, too.Experts agree that there are numerous health benefits to breakfast. For example, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics credits breakfast with helping brain function and memory as well as preventing tiredness and overeating as the day wears on. Mayo Clinic staff adds that adults who eat breakfast are likely to consume more vitamins and minerals, and less fats and cholesterol.Wake up your morning routine with these tips for a healthier start to each day:Plan a well-rounded meal. Incorporate whole grains, like sorghum, lean protein, low-fat dairy and fruits and vegetables, for a nutrient-rich meal that will keep you fueled and feeling full until lunch time.Experiment with new flavors. Avoid burnout and boredom by trying new foods. For example, substitute your typical grain with sorghum, an American-grown cereal grain. In addition to its delicious flavor, sorghum is a highly versatile ingredient that is naturally high in fiber, iron and protein and can be used in a wide range of preparations.Eliminate obstacles. If hectic mornings are preventing you from getting a healthy breakfast, find solutions that work for you and your family. Prepare make-ahead foods that you can heat in minutes or look for options that are easy to eat on the go, such as this Triple Sorghum Granola, which can be made ahead and stored in an airtight container to maintain its crunchy texture.Find more ideas for incorporating sorghum into your healthy new year at Facebook.com/TasteSorghum.

      "by Elsie WalkerIn late August, Chris Schmidt of Roxbury was riding his motorcycle when a car came into his lane and clipped him.  Schmidt kept control of the motorcycle, but his foot was severely injured; it had to be amputated. A Roxbury Township employee for five years, as a result of the accident, Schmidt couldn’t work. Schmidt has been working to overcome what’s happened to him.  Meanwhile, those who know Schmidt and his family have rallied to help them make up for the wages lost while being unable to work, plus to help with the costs for modifying his home to be wheelchair accessible. Ed Barricella, of Hopatcong, a friend and president of Cops N Rodders of North Jersey shared that some of Schmidt’s fellow Roxbury employees had given him some of their paid vacation time.  A go-fund-me page was setup at www.gofundme.com/f/caring-for-the-schmidts.  Also, Schmidt was given support by a special community of friends.  Schmidt with his wife, Kari, run SC3 Entertainment. Schmidt is well-known for doing the DJ duties at many area car shows and events. In late September, the Cops and Rodders car club held a fundraiser night for Schmidt that brought in $10,000 in donations to the go-fund-me page plus between $500 – $700 more. Cops N Rodders has been around for 20 years.  Originally, its members were from the military, state police, firefighters, etc. and not only liked cars, but most of them had hot rods. That’s how it got its name.  Today, the club includes not only those from its original member base, but also regular car enthusiasts. Schmidt has not only been its DJ for six years, but also a member.  Although he does not own a classic car, Schmidt has an interest in trucks.Thursdays are usually the club’s cruise night at Wendy’s-Lowes parking lot in Hackettstown.  However, one late September night Schmidt was the thought on everyone’s mind. Barricella noted that an announcement was put on Facebook that the night would be to raise money for Schmidt and invited other car clubs to come.  That night about 200 cars were on display and not only members of Cops and Rodders, but those from the North Jersey Street Rodders Association and the Wanderers Car Club were on hand. Hundreds of people, car owners and spectators, came.   Barricella called the night, “amazing” and said, “there were people who rode motorcycles who just came out there to support him (Schmidt).”The Cops and Rodders usually holds a 50/50 for the local organization, “Smiles For Margaret”, which helps parents of children with cancer.  However, that night, the director of that organization asked that all proceeds go to Schmidt. The event included music with DJ Matt from Monteray Entertainment taking on the DJ duties that night.However, in early October, Schmidt was back to doing his DJ duties. Working from a trailer, one of Schmidt’s first  appearances was at the Rodfather car show in Newton. He was warmly welcomed and shared, for those who didn’t know, what happened to him. Wanting to see other people spared from what happened to him when a car suddenly came into his lane, he stressed the message of keeping one’s eyes on the road and not the phone. Car Enthusiasts Raise Money for a Comrade added by new_view_media on November 4, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

Smith Day. After the History Club hosted a veterans forum last spring, Principal Timothy Rymer was talking with a local veteran who shared his enthusiasm to celebrate Corporal James. E Smith Day the following year. Rymer formed a team of faculty at the school to begin planning the October event, where they not only honored Smith, but also four other West Morris Central graduates who paid the ultimate sacrifice for the United States. Smith was honored for his service during Operation Gothic Serpent during the Battle of Mogadishu, while PFC Stanley Pfrommer (WMC Class of 1962), Lt. Allison Speirs Berry (WMC Class of 1964), SFC Larry Maysey (WMC Class of 1965), and PFC John Lindaberry (WMC Class of 1966) were honored for their service in Vietnam.  “Our entire first week in October, we wanted to devote that week to honoring all the veterans who are graduates of West Morris Central. All five of those veterans passed through these hallways and lost their lives for our country and we really wanted to honor them alongside Jamie Smith.” Rymer said.  During A Call to Courage week, history and English classes focused a lesson on learning about Corporal Jamie Smith and his life and service. Clubs got involved at the school as well, with Film Club screening Black Hawk Down (a movie that was inspired by Smith’s last battle). Veterans were also invited to a roundtable discussing with students during the lunch period on Oct. 2 to give them a chance to ask any and all questions about their service. On Oct. 4, a school wide assembly was held.  “Leading up to our big celebration on Oct. 4, we wanted to make sure every student and every staff member knew who Jamie Smith was. We had a big school wide assembly where we had a keynote speaker, Debbie Gonzales, who was Jamie Smith’s English teacher while he was a student at West Morris and she also spoke the eulogy at Jamie’s funeral. Corporal Smith’s brothers and sister were also present to honor their brother’s life.” Rymer said.  Corporal Jamie Smith was born in Morristown in 1972. He graduated from West Morris Central in 1990 and began his career in the military in October of 1990. He was assigned to B Company, 3rd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment. He was deployed to Somalia in August 1993 where he served until he was mortally wounded during the Battle of the Black Sea. After his death, he received the bronze star with valor device and oak leaf cluster and a Purple Heart.  For Rymer, this was a chance to extend the notion to the community that all those who walk the halls of West Morris Central are remembered, regardless of what activities they were involved in, if they were athletic, artistic, academically driven, etc. He calls West Morris Central a family.  “A big thing that I preach around here is that we are a big family. Our students are a part of that family, our teachers are a part of that family, our graduates are a part of that family. We’re really proud of all of this.” Rymer said.  Rymer also got the greater Long Valley and Chester communities involved when Long Valley Mayor Matt Murello provided a proclamation to the high school for Corporal James E. Smith Day before the homecoming football game on Oct. 4. The pregame ceremony included a flag ceremony and a moment to remember those students who passed through the school that paid the ultimate sacrifice.  A new initiative, P.R.I.D.E. in the Pack, started by Rymer, aims to give the kids words to describe what it really means to be a member of the West Morris Central Wolfpack. P stands for passion, R stands for respect, I stands for integrity, D stands for determination, and the E stands for excellence. Rymer, of course, wanted to tie that initiative in with their A Call to Courage Week.  “We want our kids to walk away from this assembly and this week, seeing the big picture issue. We are all a family and we are all tied together. Our Pride in the Pack permeates everything in this building and that is something we really stress. I hope our kids understand how important our history is, Jamie Smith’s impact on our hallways and our country, and that they know they will always be part of the Wolfpack family.” Rymer said.  It’s safe to say that the First Annual Call to Courage week was a major success and hopefully another long standing tradition to add even more Pride in the Pack. A Call to Courage: West Morris Central Honors Those Who Served added by new_view_media on November 4, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "By Jon Cronin  A Mendham resident and history professor is making his second Democratic primary bid for New Jersey’s 11th Congressional district.  Mark Washburne ran against Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-Parsippany) in 2016 and lost 35, 338 to 1,538, according to Ballotpedia.com.   Washburne, an avid runner, said, “I’m used to races.  If I had one bad race or a couple bad races it doesn’t mean I’ll be away forever. The first time I ran, I didn’t take money from anybody. I’ve always been concerned about money in politics, but this time I’m taking money. Politics is about learning.”  Washburne said he doesn’t want to criticize Sherrill’s work, but the incumbent is a moderate and belongs to a group of conservative leaning Democrats, the Blue Dogs. He believes that residents deserve a choice.   He was disappointed that she voted against impeachment proceedings when it came before Congress in July and against Pelosi for Speaker of the House.  He is an unabashed progressive, is very concerned about the success of President Donald J. Trump’s impeachment and published a book in 2005 about his ancestor U.S. Rep. Elihu Washburne, who was deeply involved in the impeachment of President Andrew in 1868.  “I read the Mueller report and I’m very concerned about this country,” said Washburne.  He announced his run on September 17 (Constitution Day) before Congress’s impeachment proceedings began and is relieved they have done so. He quoted Benjamin Franklin’s statement after the founding father was questioned about what kind of government America was to have, “A republic, if you can keep it.” “Keeping it is very important to me,” said Washburne.  On September 24, when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the impeachment proceedings, Washburne noted, “This is a week for the history books. On Monday there were only 135 members in favor of impeachment, today it’s 218.”  Washburne’s concern isn’t only the success of impeachment, he also wants Medicare for all to become a reality. He has been a history professor at the County College of Morris for the past 27 years and tells his students that the college doesn’t hire teachers full-time because healthcare is so expensive.  “Getting insurance through employers isn’t working,” he said.  “Obamacare is good for a start,” he said, “but it relies too much on employers, they don’t want to be in that business. It’s hard on startups.”  He explains that people paid their own insurance until a wage freeze during WWII and employers started offering healthcare as an incentive.  Then, he pointed out, that costs started going up in the 70’s.  He is in favor of President Barack Obama’s 2009 stimulus package, but is against President Trump’s tax cuts and likens it to, “having a fun night out with a credit card, but making someone else pay tomorrow.”  He added, “I would cut in the military (spending).  We’re spending more than an estimated next 10 countries.   It’s strange to have such high spending when we have more domestic issues to take care of.”  Education is also important to him.  He noted that in the 20th century this country decided on having public grade schools and high schools.  “If we’re going to be competitive in the 21st century, we have to have free college.”  His idea is to first have community colleges be tuition free followed by four year colleges.  Washburne also believes that the Stars Program in New Jersey, which currently gives community college scholarships to the top 10 percent of high school students needs to be expanded upon.  Before teaching, Washburne was a stockbroker for 10 years.  He has an MBA from Fairleigh Dickinson University.  He has taught history, marketing, business, and economics in the past 27 years of his teaching career.  Washburne is also president of Streak Runners International, a group of fellow daily distance runners who keep track of their runs.  His streak began on Dec. 31, 1989. In his career he has run 841 races and 36 marathons.   He has run the Boston Marathon 16 times.  His official website is www.mwashburneforcongress.com  Mendham Man, CCM Professor, Makes Second Congressional Bid added by new_view_media on November 4, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "On September 18, the Teams For Kids Foundation, Inc. presented a $5,000.00 grant award to the Foundation for Morristown Medical Center for its Goryeb Children’s Hospital’s Kid-Fit Program.  The funds will be used to enable underserved children and adolescents participating in the Kid-Fit program to partake in organized sports and other recreational activities to help reach their health goals. Teams For Kids Foundation, Inc. is a not-for-profit public charity recognized by the IRS under Code Section 501(c)(3) that seeks to raise funds to enable children from underserved families in new Jersey participate in recreational sports.  Teams For Kids was founded by Long Valley, New Jersey resident Abby Bauer in 2014, when she was just a high school sophomore.  Abby realized that children of New Jersey’s homeless and working poor communities were denied the opportunity to play sports and gain the many benefits playing sports and being part of a team has to offer based upon family finances.  The inequity resonated with Abby, and she decided to change the game and founded the only nonprofit of its kind that raises funds to enable disadvantaged youth in New Jersey to play recreational sports.  To date, Teams For Kids has awarded over $40,000 in grant funds and benefitted over one hundred children residing in homeless shelters, emergency, transitional and affordable housing facilities, or children whom otherwise qualify for public assistance in New Jersey.For more information about the Teams For Kids Foundation please visit www.teamsforkidsfoundation.orgTeams For Kids Foundation Donates to Morristown Medical Center added by new_view_media on November 4, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Pictured here, left to right: Dr. G. Kennedy Greene, NJASA Past President and Chief Education Officer, Newton Public Schools; Mr. Mackey Pendergrast, Superintendent, Morris School District; Mr. David Trethaway, Superintendent, Manchester Township School District; Dr. David Aderhold, Superintendent, West Windsor-Plainsboro Regional School District; Dr. Scott R. Rocco, NJASA President, Chief Education Officer, Hamilton Township School District. The New Jersey Association of School Administrators (NJASA) has selected Mackey Pendergrast, Superintendent of the Morris School District, as the 2019 Regional Superintendent of the Year for Region I, North Jersey.  Mr. Pendergrast is one of three Regional winners; David Aderhold of West Windsor-Plainsboro Regional School District and David Trethaway of the Manchester Township School District are the Region II and III winners, respectively. From the three regional winners, the NJASA will select one superintendent to represent the State of New Jersey as NJ Superintendent of the Year in the American Association of School Administrators’ 33rd National Superintendent of the Year Award, which recognizes and honors the extraordinary contributions of the nation’s leaders in public education. Now in his fifth year as superintendent of the Morris School District, Pendergrast believes the distinction of Regional Superintendent of the Year is a reflection of “the tremendous investment this entire community has made in its public schools.”  “The tangible results our district has seen over the last several years in terms of student growth and achievement, innovative programming, and operational excellence are absolutely the product of a concerted dedication on the part of all stakeholders, both within and outside the district itself.  No superintendent can succeed in isolation, and I am extremely grateful to the community as a whole for its support, dialogue, and commitment to excellence in student learning and well-being.  This is what has enabled our students and our district to ascend.” In June, Pendergrast was named Morris County Superintendent of the Year by his peers in the Morris County Association of School Administrators.  Following a detailed application process, the NJASA made the Regional Superintendent of the Year selections based on a number of leadership criteria, including meeting the needs of all students, strength in personal and organizational communication, a commitment to professional development and growth, and active community involvement.  NJASA formally announced the selection of Mr. Pendergrast and his colleagues for Regional Superintendent of the Year at its Executive Committee meeting in Trenton last Thursday and will introduce the three winners to the State’s wider educational leadership community at the upcoming NJ School Boards Association Workshop in Atlantic City at the end of October.  The State Superintendent of the Year will be selected by a committee of NJASA Past Presidents and former Regional Superintendents of the Year by November 1.  Morris School District Board of Education Vice President Nancy Bangiola called this latest distinction for Superintendent Pendergrast “well deserved, and an important indicator that influencers within the NJ public education scene are taking notice of our district and our accomplishments.”  She added that the Board “feels tremendous pride in our educational leader, and pride in the collaborative work we engage in to support him and his administration in this most consequential endeavor:  to provide exceptional learning experiences and opportunities for all of our students so that each one can ascend.” SUPERINTENDENT MACKEY PENDERGRAST NAMED 2019 REGIONAL SUPERINTENDENT OF THE YEAR FOR NORTH JERSEY added by new_view_media on November 4, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "By Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class (SW) David Wyscaver, Navy Office of Community OutreachPhoto by Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Heidi CheekA 2014 Bernards High School graduate and Peapack native is serving with the U.S. Navy aboard one of the world’s most advanced nuclear-powered submarines, USS Asheville.Photo by Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Heidi CheekPetty Officer 2nd Class Joshua Baumstark is a sonar technician (submarine) aboard the Guam-based submarine, one of four Los Angeles-class submarines forward-deployed on the island.A Navy sonar technician (submarine) is responsible for being the eyes and ears of the ship and making sure the submarine does not collide with any other vessels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Baumstark credits success in the Navy to many of the lessons learned in Peapack.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I learned how to set goals for myself and how to thrive in a close-knit group of people,” Baumstark said. Jobs are highly varied aboard the submarine. Approximately 130 sailors make up the submarine’s crew, doing everything from handling weapons to maintaining nuclear reactors. \n",
      "\n",
      "Attack submarines are designed to hunt down and destroy enemy submarines and surface ships; strike targets ashore with cruise missiles; carry and deliver Navy SEALs; carry out intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions; and engage in mine warfare. Their primary tactical advantage is stealth, operating undetected under the sea for long periods of time.  “As the only forward deployed submarine squadron, we are the quick reaction force for the Navy. We can respond quickly to any crisis,” said Capt. Tim Poe, Commodore, Submarine Squadron 15. “It’s spectacular the work our Sailors do. We ask a lot of them and they always meet the challenge.” According to Navy officials, because of the demanding environment aboard submarines, personnel are accepted only after rigorous testing and observation. Submariners are some of the most highly-trained and skilled people in the Navy. Regardless of their specialty, everyone has to learn how everything on the ship works and how to respond in emergencies to become “qualified in submarines” and earn the right to wear the coveted gold or silver dolphins on their uniform.  “I enjoy being close to where all of the action is and having to have a high level of knowledge,” Baumstark said. According to officials at the U.S. Navy’s Pacific Fleet headquarters in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, the ships, submarines, aircraft and Navy personnel forward-deployed to Guam are part of the world’s largest fleet command and serve in a region critical to U.S. national security.  The U.S. Pacific Fleet encompasses 100 million square miles, nearly half the Earth’s surface, from Antarctica to the Arctic Circle and from the West Coast of the United States into the Indian Ocean. All told, there are more than 200 ships and submarines, nearly 1,200 aircraft, and more than 130,000 uniformed and civilian personnel serving in the Pacific.\n",
      "Though there are many ways for sailors to earn distinction in their command, community, and career, Baumstark is most proud earning the submarine Dolphins and earning the Battle “E” award in 2017.\n",
      "“I accomplished these achievements through hard work and working together as a team,” Baumstark said. Serving in the Navy means Baumstark is part of a world that is taking on new importance in America’s focus on rebuilding military readiness, strengthening alliances and reforming business practices in support of the National Defense Strategy. A key element of the Navy the nation needs is tied to the fact that America is a maritime nation, and that the nation’s prosperity is tied to the ability to operate freely on the world’s oceans. More than 70 percent of the Earth’s surface is covered by water; 80 percent of the world’s population lives close to a coast; and 90 percent of all global trade by volume travels by sea. “Our priorities center on people, capabilities and processes, and will be achieved by our focus on speed, value, results and partnerships,” said Secretary of the Navy Richard V. Spencer. “Readiness, lethality and modernization are the requirements driving these priorities.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As a member of one of the U.S. Navy’s most relied upon assets, Baumstark and other sailors know they are part of a legacy that will last beyond their lifetimes, one that will provide a critical component of the Navy the nation needs.\n",
      "“I’m proud of being able to serve my country and protect freedom and democracy around the world,” Baumstark said. “Through my service I get to honor the legacy of my grandfather.”  In the Land of the Chamorros, Peapack Native Serves with the U.S. Navy’s “Silent Service” Half a World Away in Guam  added by new_view_media on November 4, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Photo: Courtesy of Ajhand JordanBy: Elise Phillips Margulis Ajhand Jordan, a senior at Morristown High School (MHS), recently received the prestigious National Society of High School Scholars Award (NSHSS).  The award is bestowed upon a student who demonstrates outstanding leadership, scholarship and community commitment.  Jordan is an honors student who completed four advanced placement classes in his junior year and is taking two more this year.  As a selected captain of the MHS football team, most of his time is dedicated to football practice and games in the fall, but Jordan is also involved in many school clubs as well as community organizations.  School clubs Jordan participates in include Peer Group Connection (a mentoring program to help freshmen), Spanish Honors Society and the Equity and Inclusion Student Council.  In the community he’s involved with EMBODI and Carrettes. EMBODI is comprised of teenage men preparing to enter college. They go on field trips to learn what post high school life will be like. Carrettes is comprised of juniors in high school and it helps raise money for scholarships.  Jordan has demonstrated impressive leadership skills as one of the selected captains for the football team and in guiding Freshmen through their first few months of school in the Peer Group Connection program. He mentioned that he enjoys, “helping to lead Freshmen down the right path during their high school years.”   Jordan said that receiving the coveted NSHSS award was an honor and that it “has only pushed me to work even harder on my academics. It has shown me that I have what it takes to be one of the great leaders of my generation, but it comes with hard work and dedication.” Jordan is currently researching colleges and doesn’t have any favorites yet. He wants to attend a school in a southern state.As for his future vocation, Jordan plans to study business but would also like to incorporate sports in his career. When he isn’t on the football field, studying, or participating in extra curricular and community activities, Jordan enjoys “spending time with his friends—usually having a meal or hanging out at someone’s house.” The NSHSS was co-founded by the great-nephew of Alfred Nobel, founder of the Nobel Prize. According to NSHSS, this honor was inspired by “the mission of the Nobel Prize to support academic and world betterment” and has been connecting members with “scholarships, college fairs, internships and career and leadership opportunities and more” since 2002. NSHSS describes their objective as “supporting young scholars to become tomorrow’s leaders.” Being chosen by NSHSS is a distinguished honor. Students qualify for the award if they score very well on standardized tests and maintain a high grade point average, including a high score in an AP class.  An educator can nominate a student who meets the following criteria; 3.5 Cumulative GPA (4.0 Scale) or higher (or equivalent such as 88 on a 100-point scale),1280 SAT score or higher, 1150 PSAT score or higher, 26 ACT score or higher, Score 4 or higher on any AP exam, Total combined IB test scores of 36 or higher, IGCSE Grade A or higher and is in the Top 10% rank in class.  Jordan’s commitment to studying, playing football, and participating in leadership activities. school clubs and community organizations have earned him the esteemed NSHSS award. That award will be a great help to him when he applies to colleges and universities in the upcoming months. Morristown High School Student Received Prestigious National Society of High School Scholars Award added by new_view_media on November 4, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "By: Anastasia Marchese The history of tomorrow is happening today, and many people who came before lived full and rich lives that continue to impact the present in profound ways. There are alot of people who are interested in keeping that history alive and continuing to see the connections between past and present while carrying their forbearers legacy into the future.  Here in Mendham, one of those people is Diana Orban Brown, who served as mayor in 2017. Orban Brown was also co-chair of the task force that developed the plan that has been proposed for an historic park at Pitney Farm. She has a wealth of information about Mendham’s history to share.  According to Orbin Brown, two of the most prominent, well known family names from Mendam’s past, are Pitney and Yardley. The Pitney family had ties to the town as far back as the early 1700’s and many generations of Pitneys had connections to the Pitney Farm part of which remains at the corner of Cold Hill and Ballentine Roads.  The farm was owned by the family from 1722 until 2013 when it was purchased by Mendham Township. Prior to the sale, the homestead on the property was the only house in Mendham to have stayed in one family since it was erected. It had housed 11 generations of Pintney’s. Some owners lived on the property year round and at different times there was a variety of businesses headed there in addition to farming.  In 1834, the property passed from Mahlon Pitney to his son Mahlon Pitney II. Between 1834 till his death in 1863, Pitney II had a distillery in the farm which made applejack from the farm’s apples and operated a forge to make wrought iron which he transported to nearby cities for market. There is also a Cider Mill located on the property that still presses apples in the fall. In the generations that followed the farm continued to function as an agricultural enterprise, with later Pitney’s adding peach trees and dairy herds at different times in their history.  Henry Cooper Pitney (1827-1911) served as Vice Chancellor of the Court of New Jersey as did his son Mahlon Pitney III (1858-1924). Pitney III also rose to serve on this nation’s highest court. He was appointed by President Taft as the 65th Justice of the United States Supreme Court. While the Pitney family looms large in Mendham history, the name Yardley is more of a household name, because of the Yardley sisters who owned an estate on Mendham Road. They were of the Yardley cosmetics fame and fortune.  Orbin Brown cited an article by Kenhi Drewes, who lived on the estate from 1949-1963.“I lived in the seven bedroom ‘guesthouse’ located in the rear of the Manor house…The sisters spared no expense in setting up the estate which included a dairy barn, green houses, chicken coops, a summer canning shed, an ice house, a standby generator, a fire protection hydrant system, an extensive water system drawing from seven springs feeding a large cistern and pumping arrangement feeding a 10,000 gallon pressurized water storage tank.”  Drewes then went on to write that around 1960 the Mendham Borough water system had to be replaced due to the wooden pipes collapsing. During that time, water was trucked from the Yardley estate to “meet the needs of the borough.” The manor house on the estate was converted to a nursing home in the 1940’s and is now Alcott Manor, a senior boarding facility. The Yardley’s and Pitney’s are just two of the many families whose history has impacted the history of Mendham over its 270 years as a town. Now as Mendham history continues to be made, it begs the question, “Which names will be remembered from this era of its history?” Only time will tell. Mendham Township Turns 270 added by new_view_media on November 4, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "The 2019 MVCA camp staff “gave back” this summer. Sixteen counselors, assistants and directors made donations totaling $150 to the American Cancer Society for breast cancer research.What started as a discussion about staff T-shirts grew into a creative service project. For a voluntary donation, each member of the staff designed his or her own pink tie-dye shirt. Camp Musconetcong Director Lindsey Cramer headed the project which was done during the camp day. “We explained what we were doing and why, and our campers loved the designs we came up with.”MVCA Director Andi Huber has supported the staff in their efforts. “Almost everyone today is touched somehow by breast cancer. One of our counselors’ mom is a survivor of the disease. This was a great way for them to raise awareness and have fun at the same time. They are good role models for the children by giving back for a great cause.”The Musconetcong Valley Community Association has held summer camp programs for 23 years at Rock Spring Park in Long Valley. The non-profit organization also offers school-age childcare, after-school theater, babysitting instruction and other programs throughout the year.TIE DYE FOR CHARITY added by new_view_media on November 4, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "How To Combat Cold And Flu(NAPSI)—According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), chances are good you’ll get a cold or the flu this year. Adults have an average of two to three colds per year and children have even more, while 5 to 20 percent of the population gets the flu. Fortunately, there are steps you can take to minimize your risk and ease your symptoms.Consider these tips from Chloraseptic® pharmacist spokesperson Maria Mantione:• Get a flu shot. The CDC recommends a flu shot for everyone over the age of 6 months. It’s easy to get—just talk to your pharmacist. It’s the best way to prevent the spread of the flu. It does not prevent the common cold, but the flu is a devastating, serious illness that could put you out of commission for a week or more or, even worse, land you in the hospital with pneumonia or infect someone you love with a weaker immune system—such as babies, the elderly or those undergoing chemotherapy.• Wash your hands often. Washing your hands with soap and water is the best way to prevent the spread of the common cold.• Prevent illness by practicing healthy habits. Make sure to get enough sleep, eat a balanced, nutritious diet, exercise and minimize stress.• If you do get sick, talk to your pharmacist about how to manage your symptoms with medications. Before cold season, stock your medicine cabinet with the essentials. Stick to single-ingredient products, so you have what you need to treat your specific symptoms. These include pain relievers and fever reducers, a decongestant, cough medicine, lozenges and a sore throat spray. Topical medications, such as Chloraseptic sore throat sprays and lozenges, are great to have on hand because they’re portable, can be used safely with other cold medicines and have very few side effects.In fact, Chloraseptic is the No. 1 sore throat relief brand around. It provides fast-acting relief for sore throats and mouth pain to help you get through your day.From lozenges that soothe nasal passages and suppress coughs to sprays that target pain when and where it hurts, there’s a broad portfolio of products based on your preferences and needs.The lozenges have a soothing liquid center that relieves pain and cools nasal passages. MAX Wild Berry is the strongest throat relief lozenge in the line. Chloraseptic Total offers a multisymptom lozenge formula that can suppress your cough for up to four hours.Chloraseptic’s sprays are the No. 1 pharmacist-recommended brand. The new and improved Cherry Spray tastes great, works on contact and is free of aspirin, sugar and gluten. The MAX Wild Berry Targeted Throat Spray is convenient for travel or to keep in your purse. The targeted spray makes it easier when you’re on the go to coat and protect specific areas in your mouth and throat. All these products are available at mass retailers, major drugstores and grocery stores.Also helping to keep you ahead of the flu this season is an online Cold + Flu tracker. To check for outbreaks and symptoms, go to www.chloraseptic.com, click on Cold + Flu Tracker and enter your zip code.How To Combat Cold And Flu added by new_view_media on December 22, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Helping Older People to Maintain Independence(NAPSI)—For most older adults, the ability to live independently is associated with the ability to drive. That’s one reason the prospect of eventually “giving up the keys” can be a frightening one.To help, the experts on aging at the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging (n4a) developed a brochure called “Before You Give Up the Keys: Create a Roadmap for Transportation Independence” that may lessen those fears by empowering older adults to evaluate their mobility needs, identify the transportation options in their community and develop a plan customized to their unique circumstances.“A too-familiar scenario is that older adults wait until they’re involved in some sort of emergency, like a traffic accident, before they really think about their driving ability and the other transportation options available to them in their community,” said n4a CEO Sandy Markwood. “Our goal is to shed light on a critical issue that will likely affect most families with an older loved one who may need to limit or eliminate their driving, and to provide a catalyst for discussion, and hopefully, action,” Markwood also noted.The n4a represents America’s national network of 623 Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs). It helps older adults and people with disabilities live with dignity and choices in their homes and communities for as long as possible.To that end, it created the Eldercare Locator. This serves as an essential, trusted gateway to help older adults, caregivers and health professionals navigate the maze of aging programs and services, as well as to assist them in identifying and accessing the resources that match their needs best. The National Call Center operates five days a week from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET and can be reached at 800-677-1116 or www.eldercare.gov.According to recent research by the Federal Transit Administration, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, n4a and the National Aging and Disability Transportation Center, the rise in the 65-plus population—some 45 million and growing—has triggered a corresponding spike in the number of nondrivers of more than 1.1 million between 2001 and 2009.“This is a major issue for older adults because when they lack access to transportation, they can’t get to the doctor, the grocery store or see friends and family as much, which means their overall well-being is likely to suffer,” added Kathy Greenlee, Assistant Secretary for Aging.Free BrochureTo download the free brochure, go to www.n4a.org/files/ResourcesforOlderAdults.pdf.

      "Protect Your Health, Protect Your Toothbrush(NAPSI)—Did you know that keeping your toothbrush clean is a simple way to help protect your health and the health of your loved ones year-round, and especially during flu season?Dentists’ Advice for the Entire FamilyAccording to pediatric dentist Danielle Gilbert-Fowler, D.M.D., “Oral health is not just about your mouth, it’s about your overall health. The mouth is a major doorway for all sorts of microorganisms, which can be linked to anything from the common cold to heart disease and diabetes. Hence, the importance of having a healthy mouth cannot be overstated.”“More than 300 kinds of microorganisms thrive in the human mouth,” explains Astrid Shroetter, D.D.S. “What’s more, the typical toothbrush is reused for months and never cleaned thoroughly.”Research indicates that kids get sick on average about 10 times a year—that’s almost once a month. While dentists and parents both encourage good oral hygiene, it would be nice to do so without worrying about potential reinfection caused by brushing teeth with contaminated toothbrushes. As Dr. Gilbert-Fowler puts it, “You wouldn’t clean your house with a dirty washcloth. Why clean your teeth with a dirty toothbrush?”A Solution“It’s important to keep toothbrushes in a clean environment and separate from other toothbrushes,” recommends Gilbert-Fowler. “Use of a Steripod® clip-on toothbrush protector will help keep your toothbrush clean and protect against outside contaminants and cross contamination from other toothbrushes. It’s important for kids and adults alike to replace toothbrushes every three months or more frequently after any illness.”Developed by doctors and independently tested for efficacy at an accredited lab, Steripod is a clip-on protector that fits any standard or electric toothbrush. Using a patented natural vapor shield of thymol, derived from the thyme plant, Steripod keeps toothbrushes fresh and clean for up to three months. Simply clip it on your electric or manual toothbrush and it goes to work; no cables or batteries are needed. You can use it at home, work, the gym, school or when you travel.More Pearls of Wisdom for Your Pearly Whites:To further put the bite on dental disease, heed these five tips from the experts at the American Dental Association:1. Brush your teeth twice a day for two minutes with a soft-bristled brush.2. Replace your toothbrush every three or four months, or if the bristles are frayed.3. Use an ADA-accepted fluoride toothpaste.4. Clean between teeth daily with floss.5. Visit your dentist regularly for professional cleanings and oral exams.Learn MoreVisit www.GetSteripod.com or call (310) 204-7880.Protect Your Health, Protect Your Toothbrush added by new_view_media on December 22, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "6 Tips for Planning Your Wedding Photos Like a Pro\n",
      "Five words or less(NewsUSA) – With everything that goes into your wedding day, those once-in-a-lifetime moments will go by in a blur, which is why hiring a professional wedding photographer is a must. After all, the last thing you should be worrying about is whether your photographer will be able to capture your big day.\n",
      "The key? Prepare yourself so that you can accurately evaluate the “right” photographer for you.\n",
      "“The best photographer will take the time to build a rapport with you and use his or her experience and creativity to capture the mood, personality, ambiance and even the geography of your wedding,” says PPA (Professional Photographers of America) photographer Berit Bizjak. “The finest wedding photography is more than a series of still pictures. It’s physical poetry — it tells the story of the day and portrays the essence of both people and place.”\n",
      "To this end, PPA, the largest international nonprofit association created by professional photographers, has taken the guesswork out of the process by offering six tips to help you plan your wedding photos like a pro:\n",
      "1. Book far in advance. The best photographers get booked quickly — sometimes as much as a year in advance — so don’t wait until the last minute to book your photographer.\n",
      "2. Show them the money. Now is not the time to skimp on your photo budget. Call around and get a price range for services, and remember: after the cake is long gone, and the dress is stored away, your wedding photos will be the only things left to share and enjoy for years to come, so don’t cut too many corners on your photography budget — you’ll end up regretting it.\n",
      "3. Make sure your photographer is a real pro. Only hire someone who has liability insurance, experience taking the style of photos you want, backup equipment and a plan for when things go south. Ideally, he or she is a PPA photographer. PPA photographers do more than just snap pictures. They have the technical expertise and artistry to make you look your best and bring your vision to life. They also abide by a strict code of ethics that makes a real difference. Watch this (video) to see real married couples share their stories.\n",
      "4. Request to see a full gallery of real weddings. Look at full wedding coverage (not just a small selection of each wedding’s best moments) to see a photographer’s true style and get a sense of how he or she might tell your “story.” Do you prefer more artistic or traditional poses? Would you rather have a photojournalist approach or a mix of all styles?\n",
      "5.Work with your photographer to create a detailed shot list. PPA wedding photographers can also help you create that shot list, as they know what key moments tell a wedding story and can prepare for those. But talk about your must-haves, and walk through the entire program with your photographer ahead of time. Share your expectations ahead of time to ensure that he or she captures the key shots, while remaining attentive and available to catch the best candid moments.\n",
      "6. Plan your post-wedding photo strategy• ahead of time! Almost as soon as the festivities are over, you’ll be eager to look at the photos so you can relive your big day over and over again. Ask your photographer for teasers or a “sneak peek” and a timeline for when the rest of the pictures will be available. Will they give you an online gallery for family and friends to choose the images they want? Again, knowing these things ahead of time will make things easy on the back end, sparing you any heartache.6 Tips for Planning Your Wedding Photos Like a Pro added by new_view_media on December 22, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Five words or less(NewsUSA) – The answer is: Yes, it’s expected.\n",
      "But it’s also a chance for all you brides out there to truly show you know that not everything is about you on your wedding day. That there really is another person involved (that would be the groom) who deserves a bit of recognition, too.\n",
      "We’re talking wedding presents — specifically, yours to your husband-to-be.\n",
      "Tradition does, indeed, hold that both you and he exchange gifts. And while it’s true that some guys are initially shocked to learn your engagement ring doesn’t also count as a “present,” that’s no excuse for you to waver.\n",
      "“Giving him something that’s just for him will make him feel really special,” advises BrideBox.com.\n",
      "Here’s what you need to know now that it’s prime time for weddings:\n",
      "* When to exchange them. Etiquette dictates that the hand-off occurs at one of three times: the night before the wedding, the morning of the ceremony, or right before leaving on your honeymoon. Think it’s bad luck to see the groom before the nuptials? “Many couples choose to courier gifts via bridesmaids or groomsmen just before the ceremony,” says Brides.com.\n",
      "* There’s a thin line between “romantic” and “mushy.” Some of you may be tempted to compile a “love notes” journal of every bit of correspondence you’ve ever sent your groom. Even assuming he’s the type who wouldn’t consider that a bit “over the top,” there’s always the chance he might be left wondering, “Okay, where’s my real present?”– especially if his gift to you is a serious piece of jewelry.\n",
      "* The consensus choice. There’s a reason a watch invariably makes everyone’s short list: It’s the perfect statement of who he is or aspires to be. (It’s also a lot more impressive than a flask, which for some reason also gets a few votes).\n",
      "No less a taste arbiter than MarthaStewartWeddings.com favors Baume & Mercier’s Clifton line — as elegant as the original 1950s model that inspired it — for the way it “easily transitions from big day to every day.” Like the Swiss watchmaker’s timelessly charming (and affordably luxurious) Classima line, it comes with a choice of straps, dial faces and a variety of what’s known as “small complications” that go way beyong just telling the hour. You can shop them at the Baume & Mercier e-boutique or by calling 1-800-MERCIER, where free engraving and wrapping are available.\n",
      "* Fun fact. One writer at AskMen.com says he’s “heard of women giving their husbands watches in the ceremony instead of a wedding ring.” If so, the answer is: No, just like your engagement ring, that wouldn’t also qualify as a wedding present.Wedding Gifts for Grooms: A Tradition Brides Shouldn’t Ignore added by new_view_media on December 22, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Want to Increase Revenue? Take Your Business Global(NAPSI)—International selling may seem daunting, but thanks to the Internet, it’s more attainable than ever. With the right tools in place, small businesses can go global and increase revenues without the headache.The question then is, “Where should I sell?” Consider these two destinations as you map out your plan for international growth:CanadaCanadians are e-commerce enthusiasts—in fact, 60 percent of Canada’s online shoppers buy from U.S.-based sellers. As an added bonus, there’s typically no language barrier for U.S. businesses selling into Canada.Given this opportunity for U.S. small businesses, the U.S. Postal Service opted to create zone-based pricing for all Priority Mail International® shipments headed to Canada starting on May 31, 2015.This means that the USPS will charge for shipping based on the U.S. origin ZIP code and the Canada destination postal code, instead of blending expensive routes into one flat rate.There will now be seven pricing zones for shipping. Some rates will increase, but for businesses in major cities—such as San Francisco, Miami and Chicago—savings will be around $8 per package.BrazilLatin America is the world’s second-fastest-growing e-commerce market, and leading this boom is Brazil. With 202 million citizens, of whom 33.5 million shop online, Brazil presents a huge opportunity for U.S.-based businesses looking to expand, though it’s not without its challenges.Due to delays in customs clearance, postal packages could take up to 20 days to arrive. Duties and taxes, as well as complicated custom forms, slow the process for both U.S. merchants and the buyers.However, there are solutions. Shipping technology company Endicia just launched a program called Endicia Global Service, which allows shipments from U.S. businesses to reach Brazilian customers in as little as 8 days. Additionally, duties and taxes can be paid by the buyer up front, and there are no complicated customs forms to fill out.“International selling is a great way to grow a business and secure additional revenue,” said Endicia co-founder and general manager Amine Khechfé. “These markets in particular are undergoing massive growth, and there’s never been a better time for small businesses to look into them.”To learn about the tools you need to succeed in going global, check out www.endicia.com/go-global.Want to Increase Revenue?

      "(BPT) – Remember free time? You used to have so much of it. But these days, work and family obligations have you running around constantly and you don’t know what to do first. You don’t even have time to do everything you have to do, let alone what you want to do.So how do you take back your day? How do you find the time to get things done and bring back some semblance of order? It is possible if you focus on making yourself more efficient. To help you accomplish all of your goals and find some free time as well, here are four ways you can improve your efficiency every single day.* Make a plan. When you’re running through your list of daily obligations the morning of, it’s easy to forget a thing or two, especially if you have children running around, phones ringing or dogs barking to distract you. Instead, plan out the upcoming day the night before. Make a list of everything you have to do and check these items against one another. Can two trips be combined? Are you prioritizing the most important things first? The better you can plan out your schedule, the more organized you’ll be the next day.* Get the news and information you need ASAP. You are bombarded by digital content every day and some of it is really important – but who has time to sift through it all? To help you find the information you need as quickly as possible, Fresly LLC launched a new app, iNews Photo. Whether you are on the go, or gathering news in your office this application allows you access to global and local news curated in real time by former journalist directly to your mobile phone or on a larger screen.* Set priorities. You don’t have time to do it all and maybe you don’t have to. Sit down and make a list of every social or professional group and obligation you belong to. Once you’ve made the list, look at it and ask yourself honestly how important this obligation is to you or your family. If you find the obligation is not essential, you’re better off to abandon it and save your time for the responsibilities that are more important to you.* Limit multitasking. Many people look to multitasking as an efficiency solution, but doing several things at once means it takes longer to accomplish any one task. And when the first task is completed, the result is often poorer because of it. Instead of trying to do several things at once, focus on the most important thing, accomplish it and move on.With today’s hectic schedules, finding the opportunity to do everything you’re supposed to do may seem impossible. However, if you apply the four tips listed above, you’ll improve your efficiency, stay up on the latest news and maybe even discover that elusive free time you sorely deserve. To learn more about how the iNews Photo app can help you find all of the information you need when you need it, and to download the app at Play.Google.com or iTunes.Apple.com, using the following code OGV1015.The 4-step plan to make your day more efficient added by new_view_media on November 15, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "medical workers working together in hospital(BPT) – Over the last decade, a number of changes have transformed the healthcare industry. The Affordable Care Act has enabled more than 16.4 million Americans to receive healthcare coverage. Advancements in technology improve both diagnoses and treatment quality. Retail health offers a convenience used by more than 10 million patients at 1,800 retail health locations. Along with the current challenges facing the healthcare system, such as an aging population, increased patient volume and physician shortages, these changes prompt the expansion of the traditional role of a nurse.Generally, Americans believe nurses’ roles are expanding as they share increased responsibilities to support the delivery of high quality healthcare, according to a poll commissioned by University of Phoenix College of Health Professions. The survey also found that adults in the United States view their experience with nurses as overwhelmingly positive. In fact, 95 percent found nurses to be a valuable addition to the healthcare system as a whole, and 87 percent view nurses as trusted sources of health information.“As nurses take on greater responsibility, and as the needs of healthcare organizations continue to grow more complex, the skills and training requirements of nurses must be prepared to match this growth,” says Betty Nelson, Ph.D., RN, and academic dean for University of Phoenix School of Nursing. “This is especially important given that the United States is currently facing a shortage of as many as 90,000 physicians by 2025.. Nurses with advanced education can help fill this shortage, particularly in areas where consumers do not have access to care.”Because of this, employers are looking for nurses with a variety of skills and certifications including:* Additional degrees or seeking an advanced degree* In-demand skills such as bilingualism, leadership and critical thinking* Flexibility and professionalism* The desire to grow into advanced practitioners such as nurse practitioners and physician assistants* Specialized training for working with various populations* An openness to diverse opportunities in a number of different facilitiesIn order to keep up with the changes in the healthcare system, at least 80 percent of the nation’s nursing workforce will need a bachelor’s degree by 2020 and the number of nurses with doctoral degrees will need to be double, according to the Institute of Medicine. Nursing education institutions play a critical role in meeting the needs of today’s healthcare system. Nurses need a place to obtain these degrees and further their skills within the healthcare industry. Institutions recognize the expanding role of the 21st century nurse and are offering a wide range of curriculum and degree programs that address recent changes in the delivery of primary care. Graduates need to be equipped with the skills they need to succeed in today’s health care market.It’s now more important than ever that nurses have the training and skills to match the demands of the growing profession. Along with the nursing community, institutions that offer nursing degree programs must work together to enhance and better prepare the nursing workforce.What employers look for in the 21st century nurse added by new_view_media on November 15, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "(BPT) – What image does the word “grilling” bring to mind? Do you envision thick, juicy burgers or steaks? What about sauce-slathered chicken breasts sizzling over coals? Cooking out is one of the great joys of warm weather, but if you leave side dishes out of your grilling plans – or stick with cold sides like salads – you’re missing out on some great flavors.Side dishes give you a chance to really show off your grilling chops, savor the farm fresh flavors of summer harvests, and indulge in wholesome, organic fare. Here are six summer side dishes that go great on the grill:1. Corn on the cob – If you’ve always wanted to try grilling vegetables but weren’t sure which of your favorites would go well on the grill – take heart! Virtually any veggie can be prepared on a grill, but corn becomes a show-stopper when grilled. Remove the husks and silk and toss the cobs right on a preheated grill. Watch them careful and keep turning them to ensure they brown but don’t burn. The heat from the grill causes the natural sugars in the corn to carmelize, and you’ll end up with the sweetest sweet corn you ever tasted!2. Fries – A trip to the grocery store or farmer’s market for fresh produce may not fit in your schedule if you’re grilling on the fly. There’s good news – frozen options like Alexia Organic Oven Crinkles with Sea Saltdeliver farm to flavor taste when prepared on the grill or in the oven. Made from Pacific Northwest russet potatoes, Alexia’s organic fries are sprinkled with bright sea salt to bring out even more of the rich flavor that Mother Nature delivered. Make a tray out of aluminum foil, spread the Oven Crinkles in a single layer, and grill for about 20-25 minutes at 400-450 degrees F. Turn once or twice during the cooking process.3. Tomatoes – If you’ve only grilled small tomatoes on a kabob, or never tried grilled tomatoes at all, this is your summer to discover grilling tomatoes couldn’t be easier. Start with large, meaty tomatoes – a variety that’s dense and has fewer seeds works best. Slice in half, brush with your favorite seasoned oil and place the halves cut-side down on the grill. Cook for 3-5 minutes on each side. Top with your favorite cheese when done.4. Kale – Grilling greens like kale helps all those wonderful nutrients and flavor stay in the vegetable and don’t disappear into the cooking water – which is what can happen when you boil veggies on the stovetop. Grilling kale couldn’t be easier. You can adapt virtually any of your favorite kale recipes to grilling by tossing the kale with the recipe seasonings and some oil. Arrange the seasoned leaves in a single layer on the grill and they’ll cook to crispy splendor in just minutes.5. Cheese – A slice of gooey melted cheese is the crowning glory atop your grilled burger, but cheese can also handle the grill on its own, and be a delicious, different side dish or appetizer. Many cheeses will work on the grill, and you can find recommendations for the best cheeses to cook on the grill with a simple online search. Slice your chosen cheese in thick pieces. Most grilling cheeses will need minimal seasoning and little or no oil. Generally, cheese takes just a minute or two to brown each side and allow the inside to melt.6. Dinner rolls – Craving dinner rolls to go with that thick juicy steak, but in no mood to fire up the oven when it’s 90 degrees outside? You can make frozen dinner rolls on the grill. Choose your favorite variety, such as Alexia Artisan French Rolls or Artisan Focaccia Rolls, set your gas grill to the temperature recommended on the package’s directions, wrap the rolls in foil and place directly on the grill. Keep an eye on the rolls to ensure they don’t burn as they can cook quickly on a grill.6 summer sides you never knew you could grill added by new_view_media on April 3, 2016View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "(BPT) – Traditional wedding rules have fallen by the wayside – food trucks are in, having a hashtag is a must, bridesmaids no longer wear the same dress and groomsmen are sometimes in sneakers. Couples are actively seeking ways to differentiate themselves and get creative. All that aside, there is one thing that remains constant – weddings must have wine.Without wine, there is no glass to raise during the toast to the bride and groom and nothing to drink when the bar closes during dinner. Wine is the first thing guests are offered when they take a seat, and – you know that they say – it’s important to make a good first impression.Choosing the right varietals for your wedding does not have to be a stressful endeavor. Whether you’re a novice wine drinker or a connoisseur, follow these four tips and you’ll please a crowd without spending a fortune:Say “cheers!” with a sparkling wine.People love a good toast, and nothing washes down a teary maid of honor speech like a glass of sparkling. Riondo Prosecco is an accessible option that’s ideal to enjoy any day of the year, but perfectly suited for special occasions. You’ll get six pours out of a bottle, so plan accordingly!Good things come in threes.In addition to a sparkling, you’ll want a red and a white option that are familiar and food-friendly. You can’t go wrong with a Merlot – look for labels from the Napa region. For a white, Terlato Friuli Pinot Grigio is exceptional and ideal for food pairing.Wine math: What you didn’t learn in school.Running out of wine mid-wedding isn’t an option, so it’s important to do the math. You should anticipate getting about 5 glasses per bottle and assume that each guest will drink one glass per hour. Follow this rule and the wine will flow all night long, keeping you and your guests happy.Don’t break the bank, but stay away from the cheap stuff.Choosing an excellent wine doesn’t mean paying top-dollar, but buying too cheap can mean sacrificing quality. There are countless high-quality, delicious, wines available for $10-$20 per bottle, so leave the cheap stuff on the bottom shelf!4 wine buying tips for weddings added by new_view_media on April 3, 2016View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "(BPT) – Around-the-clock food shows, celebrity guests and niche themed restaurants are just a few reasons the fine food movement continues to experience extraordinary growth. In 2016, more people will be seeking upscale dining experiences that focus on the unique to the luxurious — and they’re willing to pay big bucks to do so.In fact, Americans said they would splurge an average of $203 in order to have a once-in-a-lifetime dining experience at a gourmet restaurant, according to a recent online survey by Harris Poll sponsored byMichelin, the global tire maker that publishes the popular restaurant guide.What’s surprising is the people willing to pay the most for fine dining experiences are younger generations. Millennials (ages 18-34) on average would pay $282 for this culinary experience, compared to diners ages 45-54 who would shell out $170, and $122 for those 65 and older.One explanation for why younger diners are willing to pay so much is that they want to enjoy more than just fine cuisine. Many restaurants offer an overall experience that will be remembered long after the last morsel of food is gone. Whether it’s an incredible atmosphere, the opportunity to observe the chef work or gaining access to foods and cooking styles never available before, this desire for an experience is driving younger diners to invest in upscale dining.As America looks at the most recent Michelin star ratings to navigate the nation’s best eateries, there are some food and restaurant trends that are positioned to grow in 2016. Chefs will continue to expand their creative prowess by experimenting with new cooking styles and food fusions. Cooking methods will blend with science and art to create uniquely fine fare with a story that is as intriguing as the taste.Diversity is another notable trend for 2016. Authentic ethnic cuisine is in high demand and restaurants are answering the call. Traditional restaurants will begin to offer diverse plates in addition to timeless favorites to appeal to a wide range of palates. Expect to see more ancient grains, ethnic spices and worldly condiments at eateries in the future.Conscious dining is a growing trend thanks to diners’ increasing awareness of where their food comes from. Hyper-local sourcing of ingredients is being adopted by many notable restaurants. This includes growing fresh herbs and vegetables onsite and partnering with local farms for incredibly fresh dairy and meat products. Sustainable seafood partnerships are another effort by restaurants that supports the increasing demand for responsible dining options.Finally, diners are seeking chefs with the best reputation for tried-and-true favorites. That means the city’s chef with a reputation for curating and cooking the best steak will have a wait list. Supporting this nod toward the traditional, the Michelin survey found a quarter of U.S. adults say steakhouse cuisine is their favorite choice for dining. What’s the runner up? Italian ranked as the second choice nationally for the meal of a lifetime.Which 2016 dining trend do you want to try most? added by new_view_media on April 3, 2016View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "(BPT) – Snacks, produce, drinks or sweets – if it is a seasonal offering, Americans are anxiously awaiting it. According to Nielsen, Americans spend about $374 billion annually on snack foods. For many of those snack lovers, items that are only available for a limited time are one of the major highlights of seasonal occasions and holidays, especially this time of year when, according to a recent Cheetos brand survey, 65 percent of Americans profess their love of seasonal Easter treats.Whether your favorite holiday arrives in spring, summer, winter or fall, seasonal treats can sweeten your enjoyment of the season. No one wants to miss the coveted special flavors and offerings that appear on store shelves for short stints and are quickly cleared out by that clever “seasonal snack stockpiler” who is always one step ahead of you. So here’s your guide to the top treats to watch for this spring, and throughout the year.SpringIt might still be too chilly to feel like spring in some areas of the country, but St. Patrick’s Day undoubtedly marks the start of the springtime snacking season. Milkshake lovers will kick things off with mint-green milkshakes, and quickly turn their attention to Easter candies and snacks.Chocolate and marshmallow sweets are the traditional stars of Easter baskets across the country – for both the young, and the young at heart. It is no surprise that 71 percent of parents who celebrate Easter admit to sneaking snacks from their kids’ baskets, according to the Cheetos survey.Of course, everyone is familiar with jelly beans, peanut butter eggs, chocolate bunnies and marshmallow chicks, but the majority of consumers say they desire more variety beyond just candy. This year, there’s a new must-try alternative to satisfy the search for something beyond the candy animal monotony. Cheetos Sweetos, the cinnamon-sugar version of everyone’s favorite cheddar cheese snacks is reappearing in stores — and Easter baskets — this spring, but only for a limited time. Launched in 2015, Sweetos snacks are the perfect, and delicious, twist on Easter snacking.SummerFrozen treats are the highlight of summer, but not just the ice cream quarts you find year-round in the freezer cases at your local grocer. Summer means the ice cream truck will be rolling through neighborhood streets, sounding that familiar melodic “come and get it” tune and serving up frozen favorites that you just can’t find anywhere else —  or at any other time of year.You can’t go wrong with the missile-shaped, multi-colored ice pops that beckon from beside a myriad of fruit-flavored cream pops, or reliable favorites like ice cream sandwiches and chocolate-topped cones. And don’t forget snow cones — the refreshing shaved ice in perfect spheres mounted on a paper funnel and topped with your favorite sweet flavoring!FallOf course everyone knows fall is pumpkin season — and you should take every chance to enjoy all things pumpkin-flavored this time of year, from coffee and ice cream to bread, cake and pie.However, autumn also heralds state fair season across the country — and the arrival of a variety of innovative sweet treats that can only be enjoyed among the unique surroundings of fair rides, tickets and games. Funnel cakes are a state fair staple, and what could be better when the weather gets nippy than enjoying lightly sweetened, deep-fried dough dusted heavily with confectioner’s sugar? Depending on where you live in the country and which fair you attend, you can find over-the-top sweets and snacks such as deep-fried ice cream, fried candy bars and even pretzel-encrusted brownies deep-fried on a stick.WinterOf course, winter holidays are the pinnacle of seasonal snacking. From the final weeks of pumpkin season to the eggnog, candy canes and baked goods associated with holiday moments from Thanksgiving through New Year’s, winter serves up a buffet of food and snacks that are available at no other time of year.Winter’s arrival means anticipated delicacies like gingerbread-flavored everything, bite-sized candy favorites that marry mint and chocolate in holiday shapes, and of course the much-maligned and equally beloved fruit cake all hit store shelves just in time to make the holiday party circuit!Whatever your preference — savory, salty or sweet — make sure to enjoy these snacking staples throughout the year. But remember that seasonal treats come and go quickly, so be ready to grab a bag of Sweetos snacks, remember to listen for the ice cream truck’s playful tune, try your state’s delicacies and fill stockings with enough gingerbread cookies or mint-themed chocolate drops to last through the end of the year!Don’t miss these must-have snacks that define each season of the year added by new_view_media on April 3, 2016View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Be Well Tressed Every Day With Wigs(NAPSI)—Changing your hair to suit your hat, your mood or your outfit-or to make holidays and other celebrations that much more special—can be easier and more fun than ever.TV Star’s IdeaExplains Daytime Emmy Award winner Sherri Shepherd, “When I was a little girl, I would hear all this commotion in my house from my mom, aunts and grandmother when picking out their wigs for the day. It was such a good time for them and was a major part of their everyday beauty routines. Ever since then, I’ve watched the women in my household glow with confidence because they would customize their look day by day through the use of faux hair. My grandmother had a wig that she would pick out and wear perfectly with specific hats. My mother had an Angela Davis ‘power to the people’ wig. Watching these iconic women in my life pair their hair lengths, styles and colors with particular hats, outfits and personalities was exciting. Getting ready to go out was like an event in and of itself. Wigs are the perfect way for the inner diva in all women to come out and get creative, which is why I was inspired to start my own wig line to give women the choices to create their own style and look.“I always say, you were born with the hair you’ve got—now get the hair you want. Short and sassy, long and sexy or curly and fierce; you can easily change your hairstyle and transform your whole look to fit whatever your day brings. This is one of the reasons I wanted to create my line of wigs for Luxhair—I wanted to be able to give busy women high-quality, versatile looks to choose from that were simple and quick to put on but that were affordable and wouldn’t break their budget too.”The result is the Luxhair Now by Sherri Shepherd high-fashion wig and extension collection. “The collection provides the look you want, the style you want and the perfect accent to make a personal style statement, now.”Why WigsLike putting on your most stylish shoes and more powerful than a red lipstick, Shepherd says, these high-fashion styles can add some fabulous to your everyday.

      "On National Senior Citizens Day, Three Ways To Celebrate The Older Generation(NAPSI)—Whether it’s your parents, grandparents, aunt, uncle or neighbor, you likely received guidance from or looked to older people in your life as you’ve tried to become more independent and deal with change and everyday challenges. August 21 is National Senior Citizens Day, and it’s an ideal time to honor seniors for the wisdom and care they have provided us, and also to celebrate the members of the older generation by finding ways to enhance their lives as they age.There’s No Place Like HomeNearly 90 percent of seniors want to age in place—stay in their own homes as they get older. But one out of three seniors suffers a fall each year, according to the CDC. Making an older person’s home as safe as possible is integral to helping him or her maintain this independence. Walking through seniors’ daily routine with them, from the time they get out of bed to when they go back to sleep, can reveal patterns in how they navigate their home and any potential hazards. By identifying the areas of concern and making necessary adjustments, you can decrease the risk of an accident and seniors can reside more confidently in their own home.Stay ConnectedTechnology now allows grandparents to FaceTime their children and grandchildren across the globe or even in the next town, and seniors to reconnect with classmates of decades past via Facebook. Older generations can create, build and maintain quality social relationships with the convenience and ease of social media. Seniors have a multitude of online outlets to share updates, photos and videos with loved ones. To help them stay in touch, ensure that the seniors in your life have reliable Internet connectivity, and help them set up social media accounts if they don’t have one already. In-person interaction is ideal, but keeping in touch through computers, tablets and smartphones is a great way to supplement seeing and speaking with each other.Everyone’s Wearing TechnologyWearable technology like the Apple Watch is popular among younger audiences, but wearable fitness trackers and medical alert devices can provide great benefits to seniors as well. In the event of a fall or accident where it’s impossible to get to a phone to call for help, a medical alert device immediately connects the injured to emergency services. Because that person’s medical history and health needs are on file, first responders can more easily treat them. With help a push of a button away, medical alert devices give seniors peace of mind even beyond health concerns. In fact, a recent survey by Bay Alarm Medical found that 80 percent of medical alert device wearers worry less when their adult children travel because they feel the device provides an adequate support system. If you decide to help protect the senior in your life with a wearable medical alert system, it’s also wise to look for a caring, people-first, ethical provider.

      "Don’t Let The Flu Mean Missing Memorable Moments(NAPSI)—While the cold and flu season often coincides with holiday celebrations and family get-togethers, there are preventative measures that families can take to stay healthy and not miss out.To help you get to the next “can’t miss” life event, consider these top preventative tips:• Get an annual flu shot. It’s the most effective way to help prevent the spread of influenza. For your convenience, you can get a vaccine at any of the more than 7,800 CVS/pharmacy and 900 MinuteClinic locations across the country. The flu shot is available every day with no appointment needed, including evenings and weekends.As a preventive service under the Affordable Care Act, it’s fully covered and available at no cost through most insurance plans, including Medicare Part B.The pharmacy can also be a one-stop shop for flu prevention resources, including over-the-counter cold and flu remedies, multivitamins and anti-bacterial cleaning products. Plus, anyone enrolled in the ExtraCare Rewards program gets a 20 percent off CVS Shopping Pass upon getting the flu shot in most places.• Seniors, take extra precaution. There’s a high-dose flu shot designed for those 65 and older, who have a greater risk of severe illness from the flu.• Plan ahead: the earlier, the better. It takes up to two weeks for your immunity to build up after getting a flu shot. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone who is at least 6 months old get a flu shot as soon as the vaccine is available.• Stay home if you’re ill. While it may seem like a no-brainer, two-thirds of employed Americans would still go to work even if they were feeling ill with flu-like symptoms. It’s important to understand the preliminary symptoms of the flu and, if you experience them, to stay home. This will help bolster your immune system and prevent the germs spreading.• Practice healthy habits. Door handles, desks and other everyday items are ridden with germs. Wash your hands frequently with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds and avoid touching your mouth and eyes. Additionally, eat nutritious foods, drink plenty of water, and get sufficient sleep to keep your immune system in top shape. Lead by example to educate children about these habits.Learn MoreFor further information and to find a nearby store, visit www.cvs.com/flu or download the CVS/pharmacy mobile app.Don’t Let The Flu Mean Missing Memorable Moments added by new_view_media on December 24, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Medicare Open Enrollment: What You Need To Knowby Patricia Smith(NAPSI)—Every year, millions of Medicare beneficiaries must decide which Medicare Advantage (MA) plan will best serve their needs. During Medicare’s annual open enrollment period, October 15-December 7, you can change MA plans or enroll in one for the first time. Important factors to consider include premium costs, choice of doctors and plan benefits. But there is one other important question: What is the quality rating of the plan?Quality is important because it means better health care and the best value for your money. Medicare uses a system called Star Ratings to assess the quality of plans, awarding plans from one to five stars. These ratings are based on many factors, such as how well the plan does in keeping people healthy and preventing illness, how quickly you can get an appointment and see specialists, and how the plan responds to your complaints and concerns.Today, 65 percent of MA enrollees are in plans with four stars or more, compared to 17 percent in 2009. Eight of the 12 MA plans earning five stars this year are members of the Alliance of Community Health Plans, an organization representing high-quality health plans.You can learn more about MA plans using the Medicare Plan Finder at www.Medicare.gov. The National Committee for Quality Assurance also evaluates quality in MA plans at www.ncqa.org.• Ms. Smith is the president and CEO of the Alliance of Community Health Plans, www.achp.org.Medicare Open Enrollment: What You Need To Know added by new_view_media on December 24, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "How To Plan A Smooth Group Ski Trip(NAPSI)—According to a study from Wyndham Vacation Rentals, most travelers take ski and snowboard vacations in groups of four or more. Hitting the slopes with a big group doesn’t have to be hard, even when it comes to coordinating everyone’s schedules and travel arrangements.Group Ski Trip TipsWhile it can be challenging to keep everyone happy during the vacation, these planning hints can help get everyone started on the right foot.• Find the right lodging. When traveling with a larger group, alternative lodging options might be your best bet. A cabin, condo or home lets everyone stay together under one roof without sacrificing privacy. Everyone can have his or her own bedroom, while common spaces such as a living room or dining room make spending time together easy. Most rental homes also feature a kitchen, which can cut down on the stress of dining out as a large group. Have everyone take a night to prepare dinner. You’ll not only save money, you’ll enjoy time together without the interruptions of a busy restaurant.• Plan for transportation. When researching lodging, see if your accommodations rest along a community shuttle route or offer their own shuttle services. Also look into the destination’s transit systems. Sun Valley, for example, offers free bus service. If you’re renting a car, make sure you plan for times when the group splits up. Leaving half the group stranded won’t make for a fun situation.• Agree on activities beforehand. While skiing and snowboarding may be the top priorities, there are plenty of other activities to do during a ski trip. From dogsledding and snow tubing to unique local festivals, you might find attractions you just don’t want to miss. Have everyone weigh in on top choices before the trip, especially those who are attending but who aren’t avid skiers or snowboarders. Considering everyone’s preferences in advance can help reduce stress during the trip itself.• Give everyone some downtime. Opinions often differ, especially within larger groups, so allow for flexibility during the trip. If your muscles are begging for a break, read a book or squeeze in a post-run nap while your fellow travelers stay on the slopes. If half of the group wants to head downtown for the afternoon while the other half wants to get in another mountain activity, split up for a few hours. By staying flexible with the group’s itinerary, you’ll avoid any tension and better enjoy the time you all spend together.Learn MoreTo start your planning now, you can visit www.WyndhamVacationRentals.com for deals on vacation rental homes in some of North America’s top ski destinations.How To Plan A Smooth Group Ski Trip added by new_view_media on December 22, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Triple Sorghum Granola(Family Features) As you look to the new year with plans for healthier habits, there’s no better place to start than the beginning – the beginning of each day, that is. Countless studies have shown the benefits of a nutritious breakfast as part of a healthy eating plan, and there are plenty of options to make a good-for-you breakfast that tastes great, too.Experts agree that there are numerous health benefits to breakfast. For example, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics credits breakfast with helping brain function and memory as well as preventing tiredness and overeating as the day wears on. Mayo Clinic staff adds that adults who eat breakfast are likely to consume more vitamins and minerals, and less fats and cholesterol.Wake up your morning routine with these tips for a healthier start to each day:Plan a well-rounded meal. Incorporate whole grains, like sorghum, lean protein, low-fat dairy and fruits and vegetables, for a nutrient-rich meal that will keep you fueled and feeling full until lunch time.Experiment with new flavors. Avoid burnout and boredom by trying new foods. For example, substitute your typical grain with sorghum, an American-grown cereal grain. In addition to its delicious flavor, sorghum is a highly versatile ingredient that is naturally high in fiber, iron and protein and can be used in a wide range of preparations.Eliminate obstacles. If hectic mornings are preventing you from getting a healthy breakfast, find solutions that work for you and your family. Prepare make-ahead foods that you can heat in minutes or look for options that are easy to eat on the go, such as this Triple Sorghum Granola, which can be made ahead and stored in an airtight container to maintain its crunchy texture.Find more ideas for incorporating sorghum into your healthy new year at Facebook.com/TasteSorghum.

      "Locals Volunteer To Build A Better Life In GuatemalaBy Cheryl ConwayBeyond the conditions many can relate to, outside the walls of what’s the norm, exists a world so difficult to imagine unless one visits and reaches out to help.In Guatemala City, 11,000 people- in which 7,000 are kids- live and work inside a garbage dump.“Most survive by picking through the trash to earn less than five dollars a day. Many find their daily food in the dump.”Just when all hopelessness is lost for these human beings living in one of the most impoverished areas , more and more volunteers are stepping up to assist and steer them to a better life. Some local people have become very involved and formed an organization known as Beyond The Walls. This month, 75 individuals are volunteering to visit the Guatemala City Garbage Dump to build houses, donate clothing and shoes and organize sport clinics.The non-profit organization started in 2007 at the Mendham Hills Community Church, although mission teams were sent out before.“We had been going to Guatemala for a couple of years,” explains Betsy Ahl of Morris Township, executive director of Beyond The Walls. “The church was sending mission teams. We asked volunteers to help raise money to help pay for trips, build houses. They’d raise more money and that would go toward projects.”In order to influence others outside the church to get involved, and to receive matching grants from volunteers’ employers, organizers decided to expand the church group to a secular, non-profit organization, explains Ahl.The idea to help the people of Guatemala dates back to 2005, when Mendham was named one of the top wealthiest places to live in America.“The elders of Mendham Hills Chapel thought this wasn’t how others lived,” explains Ahl, “so they asked the chairman of the missions’ team to find an area that needed help.”One of the poorest places in the world, the Guatemala City Garbage Dump, was identified by a church member and the idea to team up with the Potter’s House organization, with a mission to eradicate poverty, build houses, help others get business loans and establish community programs.“It’s a ravine right in the center of the Capitol City,” describes Ahl. “They’ve been filling it up with garbage for 50 years.”In their first mission, Ahl joined 26 others for four days. The group, after that, “could have gone to Africa one year, China one year,” but the group decided it was more important to “come back and form long term relationships,” says Ahl who has sponsored three kids in Guatemala in the Kids In Potter House Education Program, in which 50 kids are sponsored to receive an education. Ahl has been sponsoring these kids since they were in the first grade, are now graduating high school and will be supported through college.Church member and organization volunteer, Mike Rubright, 50, of Long Valley, is currently on one of three missions to Guatemala this month through Beyond The Walls. His ninth trip out there during the past seven years, Rubright and his daughter, Erin, are working in the garbage dump from July 18-25.Another one of his daughters, Emily, has gone on the trip seven times but had to miss this one. Youth volunteers must be starting atleast seventh grade to participate, so for Erin this is her third trip. Volunteers must contribute $1,600 each in order to participate, with funds going toward flight and lodging; and additional funds to supplies and building houses. Every year, Rubright sends letters and emails to friends requesting donations to help support his volunteer work.About 75 people have signed up through Beyond The Walls to volunteer during the three missions this month, with 10 people from the Mendham, Long Valley and Chester areas. The others are from areas throughout the country such as Florida, New York and Texas, who formed their own groups with Beyond The Walls.Rubright and his wife, Katie, have a niece who was adopted from Guatemala so their connection is even greater.“I do construction all day long,” says Rubright. “I had no idea what I was doing; I had no construction experience. Now I’m the person in charge of construction projects my week.“Everybody builds, everybody works; it doesn’t matter how old you are,” says Rubright, principal at the Woodglen Middle School in Lebanon Twp.“We build a concrete block house with a concrete floor,” he explains. “We mix concrete by hand; it’s the hardest thing I’ve ever done. The girls and women work harder than I’ve ever seen; they don’t stop.” A family that is getting a house built works beside the volunteers.“It’s not very big,” he says, with the homes about 15 feet by 15 feet,” the size of a bedroom. Homes are for four to five person families, and sometimes six to eight people.It’s like “nine people living in the size of your kitchen,” describes Ahl. Homes are built side by side and cost $5,600 to build.A completed house consists of one big room with one eight-foot partition wall that separates the bedrooms from “everything else,” says Rubright. “They have a toilet and a shower stall” in an area about the size of a closet, and they get “a big concrete sink” that can weigh up to 600 pounds, which is used for all washing needs such as dishes and clothes.Rubright also works under Guatemala masons who are very particular with how they want things to be completed, he says.“They tell us what to do,” says Rubright. “There are a lot of times we do things that don’t make sense; you can’t tell them they are wrong. That’s frustrating. If they tell you to put a hole in a concrete pipe with a hammer and nails, instead of a drill, you do it.”The homes that are being built for the people in the Guatemala City Garbage Dump is luxury compared to the “cardboard sheet metal,” dirt, chemicals, methane gas that surround them and sicken them while living in the dump and “breathing the trash.”These houses also provide shelter and protection for these people, says Rubright, as gun shots are commonly fired in the garbage dump.His goal during this one week visit is to build three to five houses with his group of volunteers.Potter’s House has built 110 homes to date, with 75 contributed by the volunteers of Beyond The Walls, says Ahl, who visits four times, about six weeks a year.In addition to building homes, the volunteers lead soccer clinics and donate uniforms, soccer balls and cleats as well as baseball clinics and donations of t-shirts; help at a medical clinic, vacation Bible school, and deliver groceries and visit families.Through their efforts, much progress has been made such as concrete roads, a community center built last year, education programs which is much needed as the average kid does not go past fifth grade in Guatemala, says Rubright.“A lot of families look at education as not important,” says Rubright. “A lot end up working in the garbage dump” as scavengers. “They make money picking out recyclables. People sift through trash looking through recyclables to see what they can sell” or “they are looking for food to eat it.” Parents stop sending their kids to school because they need their school age kids to watch younger siblings so parents can work.If they are not scavengers, they rely on the garbage dump to sell their own goods, like tortillas to the scavengers so they can eat, and even jewelry, says Ahl.“It’s just this culture of poverty,” says Ahl, with high unemployment. “Education is not a value, that’s the bottom line. Potter’s House tries to teach the value of education especially to the parents.” It also tries to teach the vendors who do sell inside the garbage dump to sell on the outside, says Ahl.“But without education, it’s really, really hard to move their way out of the dump,” says Ahl.Scavengers are even making less these days. As the economy declined, so did the value of recyclables, explains Rubright. For those working 10 to 12 hour days, they are making two to three dollars.While “there are guns everywhere, “Rubright admits that he feels safe when there.“The organization we are with is well respected,” he says, and they stay in a retreat center with accommodations like that of a motel or college dorm. “We are safe; every store has an armed guard,” and no one walks alone. “We have relationships with people. We go to the same neighborhoods. There’s more of a comfort level now. It’s a safe place- I bring my kids there I’m not in fear of our lives.”It is the desire to help others and the appreciation that brings Rubright back to the dump.He says, “If there’s really a God, why does he let that happen? We let it happen by not choosing to use our resources that way. I don’t think I could not go back. They have so little but they appreciate everything they have. We have so much and we want so much more.”They say, “This morning I lived in a garbage dump; now I live in a mansion.”Rubright admits, “I’ve learned more from them than they get from me. I’m a better person in Guatemala than I am here.”Also nice is the community bond shared by the volunteers.For the last five or six years, the same group of people have been volunteering. “Everyone enjoys each other’s company,” say Rubright. “We work hard all day, you come back eat dinner. There’s community; there’s no television, little internet, no cell services. It’s a lot what life should be like.”Like Ahl, the Rubrights have sponsored a girl there since she was eight; now she is 17. Through their support they have helped Jennifer Lopez Munoz continue to go to school and get an education.Rubright tells people, “I have three daughters in America and one in Guatemala.”“All the kids down there, they know when we come back,” says Rubright. “It’s humbling; it’s like family.” Volunteers bring with them bags of clothing and shoes for more than 200 kids.Beyond the Walls has helped other communities outside of Guatemala, such as Native Americans, homeless people in Dover and in Newark.Rubright plans to volunteer at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota next, which is known as the poorest place in the U.S., next to Haiti, from alcoholism and unemployment faced by Native Americans. “This was their country and they are at the bottom of the ladder.”Beyond the Walls is always seeking more volunteers, contributions for clothing and shoes, and financial support.Its next mission to the garbage dump is Oct. 24-31, with already 20 people signed up.Go to Beyondthewalls.org for more information. To volunteer, email gobeyomdthewalls@gmail.com.“I encourage people to go, go somewhere,” says Rubright, Long Valley softball coach for the past 14 years and former school board member. “Find something to do where you can do something for someone else. There are people everywhere who need something. You do not need to be religious. Some people think it’s a church thing – it’s people helping other people.”Locals Volunteer To Build A Better Life In Guatemala added by new_view_media on August 18, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "MMC holds the American Nurses Credentialing Center’s (ANCC) designation of a “magnet facility;” inspired by the ANCC requirement for its “magnet recognition program,” a formal plan to expand innovation and research resources via a specialized nursing center evolved. With support from the Women’s Association for MMC, the organizers were able to realize their vision this year.\n",
      "“We are grateful to the Women’s Association for MMC for the funding to support the CNIR,” said Carol Jones, chief nursing officer of MMC. “Within ten months of receiving funding the new space was built and utilized.”\n",
      "According to Jones, the primary goal of CNIR will be “improving patient and family outcomes related to the health and well-being of individuals.” This design will be accomplished by utilizing CNIR’s research capacity to find improvements in healthcare, researching best practices or by exploring innovative changes in care delivery. PhD-prepped nurses will be spearheading all research and innovative\n",
      "endeavors at the center.\n",
      "According to Jones, one benefit of the CNIR is more flexible scheduling. For example, two formal education programs for research and innovation are held annually at MMC; the classes now take place at the CNIR, facilitating participation.\n",
      "Additionally, the CNIR will hold classes highlighting new perspectives leading to innovations in the fall. An Evidence-based Scholar Program is also now held at the center.\n",
      "Jones pointed out the various ways that the CNIR will serve the diverse needs of nurses.\n",
      "“Frequently, there is a research component associated with academic studies,” said Jones. Nurses who are required to conduct research for academic purposes [can do so at CNIR], and seek guidance from nurse researchers at the center. Other nurses seek to learn about the evaluation of existing evidence or how to generate new\n",
      "knowledge through research.”\n",
      "The CNIR is open to any nurse working at Morristown Medical Center, and no special requirements are needed to meet with the nurse researchers about new ideas or research projects.\n",
      "“Motivated nurses are welcome and encouraged to utilize the resources and space!” Jones stated, adding that the formal classes on Evidence-based Practice and Innovation require an application due to limited class size.\n",
      "According to Jones, in the short period of time since the CNIR’s opening, nurses and physicians have provided favorable feedback. The frequent use of the space, including use by interprofessional teams for concept exploration and assistance planning studies has demonstrated the need for and desirability of the center.\n",
      "Additionally, members of the non-medical community who have seen the CNIR have shared their enthusiasm for nursing activities with Jones and her colleagues.\n",
      "Expressing hope that use of the center will continue to evolve and grow, Jones stated that nursing leadership at MMC will perhaps engage members of the community and area organizations, such as the Women’s Association for Morristown Medical Center, to collaborate on efforts of how to best serve the community.\n",
      "“Serving the community, as well as improving patient outcomes, are goals of the Atlantic Health System and Morristown Medical Center,” Jones said. “Nurse leaders at Morristown Medical Center have always been innovators!”New Medical Center Aims To Encourage Nursing Innovation added by new_view_media on August 22, 2018View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Congratulations! The college process is over! The applying, the application fees, the running around for recommendation letters. It’s all over. Now the whole family is probably running to the nearest Bed Bath and Beyond trying to find which comforter is the most “aesthetically pleasing” to the ideal dream college dorm. Before running for those necessities, come back to reality and realize that this isn’t the end of the worry.\n",
      "For most families, how much money college will cost is top priority because as years continue, the prices for schools climb. Have no fear, here are some ways for soon to be college students to save and make money to help them keep college costs as low as possible.\n",
      "Apply for federal work study Federal Work Study is a program most schools have in which students receive a job through the student employment office. The money that the student earns does not go toward their tuition but instead goes to the student as cash during the semester. Depending on the school, they allow students a certain amount of money to earn. Mary Primich of Trenton, a sophomore at\n",

      "“It’s hard getting a job when you’re in school,” she says. “It’s cool how we’re able to work on campus throughout the semester and get paid for it. I use a little bit of it for day to day expenses and then the other half I save some of it to pay off my loans.”\n",
      "Federal work study is also a great way for students to get involved with their school as well as making money.\n",
      "Apply for EOF\n",
      "EOF (Educational Opportunity Fund), is a scholarship that allows New Jersey students to receive a well-rounded education that they normally would not be able to afford. Given to those students more than capable of doing great things after college, chosen applicants are given full admission to the university that they attend, financial support, and services throughout the year to help them succeed during their next four years.\n",
      "Arina Martin of Jackson, a sophomore at Monmouth University majoring in music, is one EOF\n",
      "scholarship recipient. She states “EOF has given me the opportunity to go to college when I couldn’t afford it. Without it (EOF), I’m not sure if I would have been able to go to a university.”\n",
      "Be sure to check out the school’s website for their EOF program or call the school’s EOF department for requirements in seeking this financial help.\n",
      "Staying at home for school isn’t always bad\n",
      "Community college saves students money on food, room and board as well as other expenses such as room décor and transportation.\n",
      "Kassidy Orzechowski of Clifton, who recently transferred from Monmouth to go to Bergen Community College explains “I was supposed to go to Montclair but Montclair suggested I go to\n",
      "my local community college because getting your associates degree counts as having your general education requirements completed, so it makes more sense and it’s cheaper.”\n",
      "Although some may look down upon going to a community college, many would agree that these students are making a wise choice as the cost difference between a community college and a university is evident.Orzechowski explains, “I’m paying $2,500 to be a full-time student this semester instead of $16,000+ a semester. If I did this a year ago I’d be in a better position because no matter what all of my credits would have transferred so I’d be in a better position.”\n",
      "Sell old clothes to a local thrift store\n",
      "Selling items and clothing that the student no longer uses anymore is a perfect way to not only save and make money, but to help the student determine what items are important versus completely irrelevant. By selling clothes at stores such as Platos Closet in Ledgewood, a recycling store that allows customers to sell gently used clothes for cash and other items that they do not use, the student can save space in the car for move in day and make some extra cash.\n",
      "Bryanna Welch of Long Branch, a sophomore at Monmouth University majoring in sociology, endeavors in shopping at thrift stores.\n",
      "She states “If we are comparing goodwill to Urban Outfitters, then I would be saving so much money. Usually I compare quality and cleanliness of the clothing itself. I like good will because it\n",

      "Summer jobs\n",

You get bored in the summer anyways, so why not make some money!” Welch advises to incoming freshmen to “Get a job for the summer before you go to college and save up money for the first semester for whatever it is they want to spend it on whether it be going out to eat or shopping. If you receive any money for Christmas, be sure to save it up for the next semester and file for tax returns in March!”\n",

      "“Today’s Care, Tomorrow’s cure:” This is the inspiring mission of the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation.\n",
      "On July 1, the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation in Short Hills received a three year, 6.5 million dollar federal grant to help people who are living with spinal cord injuries and other conditions that cause paralysis. Some of these conditions include spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, (ALS), stroke, spina bifida and cerebral palsy. This money will aid these people in\n",
      "the many battles and challenges they face on a daily basis, enhancing their lives.\n",
      "The foundation is the recipient of the National Paralysis Resource Center cooperative agreement from the Administration for Community Living.   The Reeve Foundation has operated the Paralysis Resource Center (PRC) for approximately 16 years.\n",
      "Quality of life: Everyone strives to obtain it, the enjoyment and independence that make life worth living. So many people take it for granted.  But having quality of life is often difficult, if not nearly impossible, when people have physical disabilities impeding their way.\n",
      "But those from the Short Hills based Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation seek to change that. Their belief is simple: That every human being should be able to obtain and lead full and rich lives, regardless of their physical condition. They have an unwavering conviction that every human being deserves a life filled with\n",
      "dignity.\n",
      "Both Christopher and Dana Reeve were staunch advocates and champions for the disabled.

      "anonymous person who was suffering with a disability: Reeve was famous, and had been considered synonymous with Superman!  But he was more than just a celebrity or a figurehead.  He and his wife Dana were activists, driven to create positive changes.

      "staunchly sought to give them hope, because he knew how easily they could feel hopeless.\n",
      "A staggering 1 in 50 people in the United States, approximately 5.4 million Americans live with paralysis of some kind. And those aren’t just numbers or statistics; they are people close to us. “We all know someone a brother, sister, friend, neighbor or colleague who is suffering with paralysis. They aren’t strangers. They are one degree of separation from all of us,” officials assert.\n",
      "The Reeves’ Foundation is dedicated to performing innovative research, securing grants, providing information and much needed advocacy to aid their clients.\n",
      "During the past 16 years and moving forward, The Reeve Foundation and National Paralysis Resource Center continue to compete in a rigorous bidding process for every three years’ worth of funding, but the results for their clients are golden.\n",
      "Since it opened in 2002, 100,000 people have been aided by this organization with approximately 20,000 people helped in the past three years alone.\n",
      "According to Anna Chamberlain, supervisor of Marketing and Communications for the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation since 2015, the Reeve Foundation has a dual mission.\n",
      "“We focus on creating resources and programs to help the 5.4 million Americans and their families impacted by paralysis though our Paralysis Resource Center while also funding innovative and cutting edge research to find cures for spinal cord injuries in the near future,” she explains.\n",
      "Offering a multitude of free services such as their peer program which offers a way of connecting individuals and caregivers with respective peer mentors to offer much needed emotional support, their military veterans program, information specialists, quality of life grants, program advocacy, and policy programs, these resources are designed to aid the whole individual.  They empower both the body and spirit, to help to navigate the insecure journey ahead.\n",
      "“The programs help individuals return to actively participating in their communities, achieving independence and self-sufficiency, achieving things we take for granted like learning how to drive again, going back to work and even leaving their own homes are also ways in which the PRC helps individuals every day.” Chamberlain enthuses.\n",
      "This recent grant will do so much for so many, making positive and uplifting differences in their lives.\n",
      "“We are thrilled that we can continue to expand our programs to help even more individuals and families create a pathway to navigate their way towards an independent and thriving future,” Chamberlain says.  “In many ways the PRC provides hope that many have lost, especially after those few days and weeks after a traumatic injury or event. I am personally thrilled we were evaluated on our demonstrated impact, value and positive outcomes. The PRC has helped so many families; it acts as a lifeline when their lives have changed in an instant. The grant will keep that lifeline open for those who need it the most.”\n",
      "Chamberlain sums up the mission of the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation perfectly: “We not only are giving helpful tools (to clients), we are giving hope.”\n",

      "By Elsie WalkerThirty-five years ago, Terry Cook Delahaya USA in Chester started a car show that turned into an event like no other: Lead East, known as the world’s biggest ‘50’s party. The event grew to become a journey back in time to the music, dance, movies, and sights of the 1950s.\n",
      "After the last Lead East, Cook decided to retire to write a book. However, the party isn’t over. Four longtime Lead East attendees from the Hope area have taken ownership of the event and Jim Craig of Great Meadows has become event coordinator. With these changes, Lead East still features an abundance of classic cars, but it is morphing from a party into a festival of the 1950s, with more offerings for kids than in the past. Classic cars are still a big part of it, as is the spirit of giving. Lead East will run from Thursday, Aug. 30 to Sunday, Sept. 2 at the Parsippany Hilton.\n",
      "“We want to open the door to more generations and introduce other generations to the ‘50’s,” explained Craig. He compares attending Lead East to being beamed up to a spaceship and taken back in time. Things were different then. “In the ‘50s, everything was American; it was an American phenomenon,” he said.\n",
      "Lead East has always had the sounds of rock and roll bands and accapella do-wop groups, the look of ‘50s fashion like poodle skirts and greased back hair, plus a traditional prom and even Elvis sightings. Now, it is offering more for not only those who remember the ‘50s, but those experiencing it for the first time.\n",
      "Craig shared that people can learn about how to dress like the ‘50’s or to decorate their home ‘50’’s style. Country line dancing has been added to the dance lesson offerings. Craig noted that classic country was also part of the ‘50’s. For kids there will be Craigles the clown, a clown mobile, a flea circus, face painting, balloon animals and contests.  A model making contest will be open to both boys and girls, in two different age groups. The children will be supplied with model car kits and judged on who does best at putting one together. Another contest for kids is to see who can get the best greaser (greaser down hair) look.\n",
      "Of course, Lead East wouldn’t be Lead East without cars with 1,400 plus cars expected to arrive by Friday of the event. They come from not only New Jersey, but a variety of states. Also, they’re not all from the ‘50s. There will be cars from the 1930s – 1970s: classics, rot rods, muscle cars and more.\n",
      "One aspect of Lead East is that of giving. Every year, Lead East picks a charity to support and this year it is the Ashley-Lauren Foundation which helps children in N.J. who have cancer. There will be a booth at which 50/50 tickets will be sold.\n",
      "Also, as it has been for many years, Piccatinny Arsenal, from Dover, will be on hand showing some of its military vehicles and collecting toys for Toys for Tots to be given out to needy area children at Christmas. The Parsippany police and fire departments are also expected to be on hand with vehicles and taking donations.\n",

      "With teen suicide on the rise throughout the state, Senator Richard Codey (D-Livingston), recently unveiled a $1 million plan to combat depression and help educate people on mental health.\n",
      "On July 1, the former governor introduced a bill that will award a $1 million grant within the NJ Department of Education (DOE) for school districts to hire mental health counselors.\n",
      "The NJ Department of Health will determine which school districts are awarded grants. The DOE will report on progress by 2021. There will be specialized training workshops to non-licensed, auxiliary school staff who interact with students and a creation of a statewide “Teen Suicide and Depression Task Force” charged with developing additional methods to combat teen suicide and depression and report back to the state legislature by July 2019.\n",
      "“School workers such as secretaries, security guards and teacher’s aides need the tools and training to recognize bullying, early warning signs and symptoms of mental health issues, and the proper steps to resolve conflict and prevent potential disasters,” declared Governor Codey at a press conference at Liberty Middle School in West Orange in May.\n",
      "According to the New Jersey Youth Suicide Report, 2,731 people age 10 to 24 were treated in an emergency room for non-fatal suicide attempts/self-inflicted injuries from 2013 to 2015. Also, according to the New Jersey Dept. of Health, from 2007 to 2016, suicides among children ages 10 to 18 rose by 16.6 percent.\n",
      "“Too many young lives are being lost,” Codey said at the press conference. “New Jersey must act now to better equip all school employees to help identify at-risk students and prevent teen suicides and other mental health related incidents in their schools.”\n",
      "Codey and his wife, Mary Jo Codey, have been involved with mental health since 2012 when they established the Codey Fund for Mental Health. The organization’s goal is to educate people about mental health and provide quality treatment for individuals with mental illness.\n",
      "Mary Jo has dealt with depression and Codey has met with many parents who have lost kids to suicide, including Dianne Grossman of Rockaway, whose daughter Mallory took her own life at age 12 in June 2017 and Rachelle St. Phard, whose son Coby committed suicide in March 2016 at age 18.\n",
      "The governor has been surrounded by death most of his life. He is the owner of Codey and Jones Funeral Home in Caldwell, but noted that he has never seen so saw many young people die until recently.\n",
      "Codey feels that social media is a huge factor in teen depression and suicide. Instead of being outside with friends or being active, bullying follows kids home onto Snapchat, Twitter or Facebook, making their lives even worse, he said.\n",
      "With the recent suicides of designer Kate Spade and renowned chef, Anthony Bourdain, depression can affect anyone, he said. The governor hopes these deaths may get people to talk about depression.“The biggest thing for mental health is to overcome the stigma of depression,” he said. “Teenage suicide is not a comfortable issue for people to talk about.”Governor Cody Aims To Prevent Teen Suicide added by new_view_media on July 18, 2018View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

Dinday raised $2,500 for The Arc/Morris County Chapter, which is the largest provider of services for people affected by intellectual and related developmental disabilities and their families in Morris County. “This trip was the first overnight bike ride for any trip that I’ve ever done,” Dinday said. Dinday’s uncle, James Krauklis, lived at the facilities in Morristown, Flanders and Parsippany for many years with Down Syndrome, but passed away in 2004. After his death, his family donated $250,000 to the Arc Day Training Center in Flanders in honor of him and his parents, Julius and Loretta, who were founding members of The Arc. As Dinday was nearing the end of his ride, he made it to Arc in Flanders on Aug. 26. Executive Director Bill Testa said it was an honor that he raised money for the organization, but it was even more of a privilege for him and the clients to meet Dinday. Testa, who knew Loretta and Julius, said it was nice to see another member of the family giving back. “It’s not just about the money that he raised,” Testa said. “It was more the public awareness. He obviously realized the importance of supporting people with special needs.”Testa recalled how special of a day it was for the residents at the facility. Their faces lit up when they saw him and they enjoyed interacting with Dinday. “I don’t think he was expecting the reaction he got,” Testa stated.While Dinday only met his uncle a couple times, he knew the impact Arc had on his life. According to Dinday, he had wanted to ride cross country since his early 20s and he decided this year the time was right. “It’s something I wanted to do for quite a long time,” he said. After 16 years of studying epilepsy at the University of California San Francisco, he quit his job and began preparing for his journey. He went to the gym three or four times a week, biked often and researched routes, places for food, hotels and camp sites. The beginning of the trip was a challenge, he said. He rode up the coast of California, in the direction of the wind, while most people were going the opposite way. “The first few weeks were an amusing learning curve,” he commented. Dinday biked eight hours a day, mapped out most of the trip before he left, slept in cheap motels or camps and often ate cheap gas station food, forgetting what good food tasted like. Once he made it up the coast he reached Portland, Ore. From there he went east along the Columbia River into Washington, then to the panhandle of Idaho, continued into Montana and then south where he reached Yellowstone. Next, he went south to Wyoming, north to South Dakota, then to Iowa and then made a pit stop in the Windy City, where he visited family. While in Chicago, he paused his trip for a week to celebrate his mom Mary’s 70th birthday in Hawaii. After returning from the celebration, his ride continued along Lake Michigan into Indianapolis and then stopped in Louisville, where he had some of its famous bourbon. Dinday pressed on through Ohio, east into Pittsburgh, then Allentown, Pa., north into New York City, where he went to a Mets game and eventually finished in Portland, Me.In total, the trip was a little more than four months and 125 days of riding. “In the broadest strokes, it’s (the ride) what I thought it would be,” Dinday remarked. “It just was not as difficult as I thought it would be.”Dinday told the Mt. Olive News some highlights of the trip include the Grand Canyon and Yellowstone and seeing a girl riding a go cart smoking a cigarette at an intersection in Montana. He noted she was likely the weirdest person he saw on the ride. Dinday stressed the four month crusade was no cake walk. Physically, it was draining and there were numerous times when he felt like he couldn’t go anymore. Also, he often had to choose between staying in a fleabag motel or riding for another few hours. Additionally, he spent a few days with his seat tied with zip ties because the seat clamp broke. Dinday said it took him a while to recover from the trip, but now he is in the market for a job. It was a once in a lifetime experience, he said. “I would have done this even without the fundraising” he said. “I regret not quitting my job after 15 years.”California Resident Bikes Cross Country to Benefit Mt Olive Organization added by new_view_media on November 4, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      " Morris County Sheriff James M. Gannon has selected Kelley Zienowicz as the person to lead the Sheriff’s Office into the future. Kelley Zienowicz, a graduate of the elite FBI National Academy, will be promoted to the rank of Chief Morris County Sheriff’s Officer, the highest-level Officer position in the Sheriff’s Office Bureau of Law Enforcement. Chief Zienowicz’s promotion will formally take place on Sept. 3, 2019, during a swearing-in ceremony, making her the highest-ranking woman in the Morris County Sheriff’s Office and the sole female chief in Morris County. “I am so proud to announce the promotion of Kelley Zienowicz to Chief Sheriff’s Officer of the Morris County Sheriff’s Office,” Sheriff James M. Gannon said. “Chief Zienowicz has a temperament that motivates and energizes others. She is highly-educated, a graduate of the elite FBI National Academy, and a true leader with an impeccable work ethic.” “With Chief Zienowicz at the helm of day-to-day operations overseeing all divisions in the Sheriff’s Office Bureau of Law Enforcement, we will accomplish great things which the people of Morris County deserve,” Sheriff Gannon said.  “Not only am I proud to have the backing of the Sheriff, I know this is an important time for the agency as a whole. I hope to bring positive  motivation to the agency, from the top to the bottom,” Chief Zienowicz said. As Chief, she will be responsible for management and day-to-day oversight over the Bureau of Law Enforcement’s four divisions: Support Services, Protective Services, Legal Services, and Special Services, which includes the Crime Lab and Crime Scene Investigation Unit. Chief Zienowicz – who has received multiple awards, including the New Jersey Women in Law Enforcement Breaking the Glass Ceiling Award – will be promoted to Chief from her previous rank of Detective Lieutenant. Chief Zienowicz grew up in Chester and attended Villa Walsh Academy.  She earned a bachelor of arts degree in psychology from Boston College in 1999, and a master of arts degree in forensic psychology from John Jay College in New York City in 2003. She began her career with the Morris County Sheriff’s Office in 1999 as a civilian clerk-typist assigned to the Internal Affairs Section.  Within a year, she was hired as a Sheriff’s Investigator and in 2001, she attended and completed training at the Morris County Police Academy. Chief Zienowicz was first assigned to the Protective Services Division, which provides security and judicial protection at the courthouse complex. In August 2001, she was assigned to the Criminal Investigation Section – now called Crime Scene Investigation (CSI) – and spent 11 years in the Unit, assisting in multiple criminal investigations throughout Morris County. She was called as a witness for the prosecution in several high-profile criminal cases in Superior Court between 2003 and 2014. She was qualified as an expert fingerprint witness in the sexual assault trial and retrial of Andrew Pena, and testified about evidence in the murder trials of Jose Feliciano, convicted of murdering the Rev. Edward Hinds in Chatham in 2009; Anthony Novellino, convicted of killing his former wife, Judith, in Denville; and Carlos Rojas, found guilty of bludgeoning Esteban Hernandez Vazquez and leaving his body in the trunk of a car abandoned in Lincoln Park. Chief Zienowicz was promoted to the rank of Sergeant in April 2012 and assigned to the Legal Services Division as the Executions and Foreclosure Section Supervisor. That promotion was followed on March 1, 2016, by another advancement to the rank of Detective Lieutenant. She was assigned the post of Division Commander in the Administrative Division, overseeing Internal Affairs and the Special Operations Section. She then was transferred to the Protective Services Division in September 2016, where she oversaw the courthouse complex and operations and security at the Dover Probation Office. One of her most profound pleasures was her nomination to attend the 273rd Session of the prestigious FBI National Academy, a 10-week course of study in Quantico, Virginia, in the summer of 2018. Sheriff Gannon, who backed the nomination, is an FBI National Academy Graduate, as well. The FBI National Academy is a professional course of study for U.S. and international law enforcement managers who are nominated by their agency heads because of their demonstrated leadership abilities. The program provides coursework on intelligence theory, terrorism, terrorist mindsets, management science, law, behavioral science, communication and forensic science to improve the administration of justice in police departments and agencies. Upon returning from the FBI National Academy, Chief Zienowicz in September 2018 was transferred to the Special Services Division, overseeing CSI, Evidence Section, and the Bomb Unit. Assisting in the implementation of new technologies at the Sheriff’s Office, Chief Zienowicz was a member of the Evidence Unit start-up team for the BEAST evidence tracking system, guided implementation of the CivilServe civil process database system in the Executions and Foreclosure Unit, and coordinated use of the new Computer Aided Dispatch System within the Protective Services Division. Chief Zienowicz has logged a voluminous number of hours on training, including intensive courses on crash reconstruction, supervision of police personnel, shooting analysis and reconstruction, and interpretation of bloodstain patterns. She has received the Sheriff’s Achievement Award, Exceptional Duty Award, Unit Citation Medal, Professional Service Medal, Educational Achievement Medal-Masters Degree, Morris County Detective’s Association Distinguished Achievement Unit Award, and the NJ Women in Law Enforcement Breaking the Glass Ceiling Award, which is awarded to women who achieve a law enforcement rank of lieutenant or higher. Chief Zienowicz is a three-time Police Unity Tour rider and participates annually in the Special Olympics Torch Run.Chief Kelley Zienowicz Becomes Highest Ranking Woman in Morris County Sheriff’s Office added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "by Elsie Walker Halloween will soon be here.  Many times on Halloween, or around camp fires, stories of ghosts; strange, creepy or haunted places; and recollections of strange occurrences are shared.  Some people pass stories on from generation to generation until they become legend. However, others, like members of the New Jersey Ghost Hunters Society (NJGHS), investigate strange occurrences to see if there is a paranormal presence involved.  Recently, people from around the coverage area shared stories and sightings of local ghosts, rumors of haunted locations, and experiences with the paranormal. Members of the online, “You Know You’re From Roxbury Township….” group recalled ghost tales and scary sights.  One popular ghost story was the Hooker Man. It is about a ghost seen by the Succasunna railroad tracks. “The Hooker Man lost his hand in some freak train accident, and now searches for it with a lantern,” shared Mike Stark, Roxbury.   However, it appears the Hooker Man has not only been seen in Roxbury, but Netcong, Flanders, Chester, and Long Valley also lay claim to the legend. Cheryl McClung, a former area resident, who now lives in Georgia, shared, “At night, people see his [the Hooker Man’s] lantern bouncing along the tracks in Flanders on the west side of [Route} 206. Dawn Traetta Hair, of Florida, another former Roxbury resident, remembers the stories of the former location of the Church of the Mystic Light in Flanders.  The building is closed, but there had been claims that witches had hung chickens and have had seances there. People still stop by it, out of curiosity, if not scared away.Kim Howell Candore shared that there have been ghost sightings at her childhood home, “I was raised at 11 Meeker Street [in] Succasunna, next to the cemetery. There has been many spottings of two men in Civil War uniforms smoking, sitting on a tree stump in front of our old house,”   said Candore, who now lives in Tennessee. Candore remembers that the two churches on Main Street, adjacent to the cemetery, used to be a military hospital. Also shared, was that Roxbury has its very own “haunted house” in the form of the Halloween House, a tremendous display put on by the Heard family in Roxbury.Hackettstown is the meeting site of the NJ Ghost Hunters Society.  The society’s mission statement is “To search out definitive proof of life beyond the grave.  To provide paranormal investigations to those who request them, free of charge. To train those individuals, who so desire and become members of the NJGHS, in the protocols of professional, ethical and scientific paranormal investigating..” L’aura  Hladik Hoffman is the society’s founder and director. She is the author of Ghosthunting New Jersey, Ghosthunting New York City, and Ghosts of the Poconos and has a variety of presentations on the paranormal which will be given at area libraries this month  (listed on the bottom of www.njghs.net/presentations.html). Recently, Hoffman recalled stories she was told of two ghosts who are said to haunt Bea McNally’s (formerly Charlie Brown Restaurant).  In 1878, the place was the Clarendon House (hotel) and from 1926-1947 it was the Hackettstown Inn.  “The ghost girl appeared to a young girl who was living at the hotel when her family owned it. She snuck down to the kitchen in the middle of the night for some ice cream. When she was headed out of the kitchen and into the dining room to sneak back upstairs, she was met with this bright, sparkling light and out of the light stepped a young girl – about the same age of the girl sneaking the ice cream – and the ghost girl was dressed from a different time period and clutching her teddy bear. The ice cream girl screamed, dropped the ice cream and ran up to her room. The next day when her parents confronted her about the mess in the dining room, they did not believe her about the ghost girl she saw. However, a couple weeks later, the father saw the ghost girl, too.”As for the other ghost, Hoffman said there are various origin stories as to who he is. Most have to do with drowning. Two versions have him as a child who was staying upstairs and died while unattended in the bathtub.  Hoffman shared that in another version of the story, “A Lady of the Evening was distraught over unrequited love of one of her clients and she took a bath and drank a bottle of gin and passed out and drowned.” However, most seem to think the ghost is a child as they have got the sensation of someone wanting to ride on their shoulders or putting a small hand into theirs.Over the years there have been other stories of ghostly presence at the location, such as unexplained footsteps and, when there was a pool hall at the location, how when it was unlocked for business one day,  instead of the cleaned pool hall, cues, etc. were strung all over. In Pompton Lakes, Laura Jennings, a member of the historic commission there, shared about some caring spirits at the Schuyler Colfax house ( Hamburg turnpike, Wayne)  “Dr. Jane Colfax Young grew up in the house with her father (Dr. Richard S. Colfax) and Aunt (also Dr. Jane Colfax). Katherine Young, daughter to Jane Colfax Young, shared that she spent a lot of time in the home until he was ten years old. Both her and her father felt and saw things in the house that they are sure were the spirits of their ancestors watching over them. The Colfax family is one of the founding families in the area.”Jennings also shared that she had heard reports of ghost sightings at the Lenox School in Pompton Plains.Morristown has had its own dealing with the paranormal.  Pat Goodfriend, Membership & Volunteer Coordinator for the Morris County Historical Society shared a short 2016 article by Y. McGreevy on Ford Mansion. The mansion at the Morristown National Historical Park is over 200 years old.  Once the home of George Washington (briefly during 1780), the mansion drew the interest of Gordon Thomas Ward, a paranormal investigator, who in 2016, did a presentation on the Mansion and his two-year study of it, including the noises said to be coming from inside its walls.  An article by B. LaMuraglia the same year shows that during the time of his investigation, Ward heard the voices of three male and two female spirits.  None were Washington; Ward felt at least one could have been a kitchen servant. Bells Mansion, near the Netcong-Stanhope border has also been the subject of a paranormal study.  That was shared by Tom Lupo of Hopatcong, a producer who followed the NJ Ghost Hunters Society when it investigated the restaurant six years ago.  The segment includes a worker recalling seeing the spirit of a woman. He was cleaning up after the restaurant had closed. There are windows between the rooms.  He looked up and saw a woman, seated in the next room, looking out at the road. He watched her for about 10 seconds and then went to approach her. When he walked into that room, she was gone. This Halloween, will the Hooker Man or the little girl ghost at Bea McNally’s be seen?  Will voices whisper through Ford Mansion or the Lenox School? Perhaps, this year, a new spirit will be seen and its legend begun. Hauntings Around the Area for Halloween added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Unveiled earlier this year after several years of planning, the Center for Nursing Innovation and Research (CNIR) for Morristown Medical Center (MMC) is providing greater research and innovation.\n",
      "MMC holds the American Nurses Credentialing Center’s (ANCC) designation of a “magnet facility;” inspired by the ANCC requirement for its “magnet recognition program,” a formal plan to expand innovation and research resources via a specialized nursing center evolved. With support from the Women’s Association for MMC, the organizers were able to realize their vision this year.\n",
      "“We are grateful to the Women’s Association for MMC for the funding to support the CNIR,” said Carol Jones, chief nursing officer of MMC. “Within ten months of receiving funding the new space was built and utilized.”\n",
      "According to Jones, the primary goal of CNIR will be “improving patient and family outcomes related to the health and well-being of individuals.” This design will be accomplished by utilizing CNIR’s research capacity to find improvements in healthcare, researching best practices or by exploring innovative changes in care delivery. PhD-prepped nurses will be spearheading all research and innovative\n",
      "endeavors at the center.\n",
      "According to Jones, one benefit of the CNIR is more flexible scheduling. For example, two formal education programs for research and innovation are held annually at MMC; the classes now take place at the CNIR, facilitating participation.\n",
      "Additionally, the CNIR will hold classes highlighting new perspectives leading to innovations in the fall. An Evidence-based Scholar Program is also now held at the center.\n",
      "Jones pointed out the various ways that the CNIR will serve the diverse needs of nurses.\n",
      "“Frequently, there is a research component associated with academic studies,” said Jones. Nurses who are required to conduct research for academic purposes [can do so at CNIR], and seek guidance from nurse researchers at the center. Other nurses seek to learn about the evaluation of existing evidence or how to generate new\n",
      "knowledge through research.”\n",
      "The CNIR is open to any nurse working at Morristown Medical Center, and no special requirements are needed to meet with the nurse researchers about new ideas or research projects.\n",
      "“Motivated nurses are welcome and encouraged to utilize the resources and space!” Jones stated, adding that the formal classes on Evidence-based Practice and Innovation require an application due to limited class size.\n",
      "According to Jones, in the short period of time since the CNIR’s opening, nurses and physicians have provided favorable feedback. The frequent use of the space, including use by interprofessional teams for concept exploration and assistance planning studies has demonstrated the need for and desirability of the center.\n",
      "Additionally, members of the non-medical community who have seen the CNIR have shared their enthusiasm for nursing activities with Jones and her colleagues.\n",
      "Expressing hope that use of the center will continue to evolve and grow, Jones stated that nursing leadership at MMC will perhaps engage members of the community and area organizations, such as the Women’s Association for Morristown Medical Center, to collaborate on efforts of how to best serve the community.\n",
      "“Serving the community, as well as improving patient outcomes, are goals of the Atlantic Health System and Morristown Medical Center,” Jones said. “Nurse leaders at Morristown Medical Center have always been innovators!”New Medical Center Aims To Encourage Nursing Innovation added by new_view_media on August 22, 2018View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Congratulations! The college process is over! The applying, the application fees, the running around for recommendation letters. It’s all over. Now the whole family is probably running to the nearest Bed Bath and Beyond trying to find which comforter is the most “aesthetically pleasing” to the ideal dream college dorm. Before running for those necessities, come back to reality and realize that this isn’t the end of the worry.\n",
      "For most families, how much money college will cost is top priority because as years continue, the prices for schools climb. Have no fear, here are some ways for soon to be college students to save and make money to help them keep college costs as low as possible.\n",
      "Apply for federal work study Federal Work Study is a program most schools have in which students receive a job through the student employment office. The money that the student earns does not go toward their tuition but instead goes to the student as cash during the semester. Depending on the school, they allow students a certain amount of money to earn. Mary Primich of Trenton, a sophomore at\n",

      "“It’s hard getting a job when you’re in school,” she says. “It’s cool how we’re able to work on campus throughout the semester and get paid for it. I use a little bit of it for day to day expenses and then the other half I save some of it to pay off my loans.”\n",
      "Federal work study is also a great way for students to get involved with their school as well as making money.\n",
      "Apply for EOF\n",
      "EOF (Educational Opportunity Fund), is a scholarship that allows New Jersey students to receive a well-rounded education that they normally would not be able to afford. Given to those students more than capable of doing great things after college, chosen applicants are given full admission to the university that they attend, financial support, and services throughout the year to help them succeed during their next four years.\n",
      "Arina Martin of Jackson, a sophomore at Monmouth University majoring in music, is one EOF\n",
      "scholarship recipient. She states “EOF has given me the opportunity to go to college when I couldn’t afford it. Without it (EOF), I’m not sure if I would have been able to go to a university.”\n",
      "Be sure to check out the school’s website for their EOF program or call the school’s EOF department for requirements in seeking this financial help.\n",
      "Staying at home for school isn’t always bad\n",
      "Community college saves students money on food, room and board as well as other expenses such as room décor and transportation.\n",
      "Kassidy Orzechowski of Clifton, who recently transferred from Monmouth to go to Bergen Community College explains “I was supposed to go to Montclair but Montclair suggested I go to\n",
      "my local community college because getting your associates degree counts as having your general education requirements completed, so it makes more sense and it’s cheaper.”\n",
      "Although some may look down upon going to a community college, many would agree that these students are making a wise choice as the cost difference between a community college and a university is evident.Orzechowski explains, “I’m paying $2,500 to be a full-time student this semester instead of $16,000+ a semester. If I did this a year ago I’d be in a better position because no matter what all of my credits would have transferred so I’d be in a better position.”\n",
      "Sell old clothes to a local thrift store\n",
      "Selling items and clothing that the student no longer uses anymore is a perfect way to not only save and make money, but to help the student determine what items are important versus completely irrelevant. By selling clothes at stores such as Platos Closet in Ledgewood, a recycling store that allows customers to sell gently used clothes for cash and other items that they do not use, the student can save space in the car for move in day and make some extra cash.\n",
      "Bryanna Welch of Long Branch, a sophomore at Monmouth University majoring in sociology, endeavors in shopping at thrift stores.\n",

You get bored in the summer anyways, so why not make some money!” Welch advises to incoming freshmen to “Get a job for the summer before you go to college and save up money for the first semester for whatever it is they want to spend it on whether it be going out to eat or shopping. If you receive any money for Christmas, be sure to save it up for the next semester and file for tax returns in March!”\n",

      "“Today’s Care, Tomorrow’s cure:” This is the inspiring mission of the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation.\n",
      "On July 1, the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation in Short Hills received a three year, 6.5 million dollar federal grant to help people who are living with spinal cord injuries and other conditions that cause paralysis. Some of these conditions include spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, (ALS), stroke, spina bifida and cerebral palsy. This money will aid these people in\n",
      "the many battles and challenges they face on a daily basis, enhancing their lives.\n",
      "The foundation is the recipient of the National Paralysis Resource Center cooperative agreement from the Administration for Community Living.   The Reeve Foundation has operated the Paralysis Resource Center (PRC) for approximately 16 years.\n",
      "Quality of life: Everyone strives to obtain it, the enjoyment and independence that make life worth living. So many people take it for granted.  But having quality of life is often difficult, if not nearly impossible, when people have physical disabilities impeding their way.\n",
      "But those from the Short Hills based Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation seek to change that. Their belief is simple: That every human being should be able to obtain and lead full and rich lives, regardless of their physical condition. They have an unwavering conviction that every human being deserves a life filled with\n",
      "dignity.\n",
      "Both Christopher and Dana Reeve were staunch advocates and champions for the disabled.

      "staunchly sought to give them hope, because he knew how easily they could feel hopeless.\n",
      "A staggering 1 in 50 people in the United States, approximately 5.4 million Americans live with paralysis of some kind. And those aren’t just numbers or statistics; they are people close to us. “We all know someone a brother, sister, friend, neighbor or colleague who is suffering with paralysis. They aren’t strangers. They are one degree of separation from all of us,” officials assert.\n",
      "The Reeves’ Foundation is dedicated to performing innovative research, securing grants, providing information and much needed advocacy to aid their clients.\n",
      "During the past 16 years and moving forward, The Reeve Foundation and National Paralysis Resource Center continue to compete in a rigorous bidding process for every three years’ worth of funding, but the results for their clients are golden.\n",
      "Since it opened in 2002, 100,000 people have been aided by this organization with approximately 20,000 people helped in the past three years alone.\n",
      "According to Anna Chamberlain, supervisor of Marketing and Communications for the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation since 2015, the Reeve Foundation has a dual mission.\n",
      "“We focus on creating resources and programs to help the 5.4 million Americans and their families impacted by paralysis though our Paralysis Resource Center while also funding innovative and cutting edge research to find cures for spinal cord injuries in the near future,” she explains.\n",
      "Offering a multitude of free services such as their peer program which offers a way of connecting individuals and caregivers with respective peer mentors to offer much needed emotional support, their military veterans program, information specialists, quality of life grants, program advocacy, and policy programs, these resources are designed to aid the whole individual.  They empower both the body and spirit, to help to navigate the insecure journey ahead.\n",
      "“The programs help individuals return to actively participating in their communities, achieving independence and self-sufficiency, achieving things we take for granted like learning how to drive again, going back to work and even leaving their own homes are also ways in which the PRC helps individuals every day.” Chamberlain enthuses.\n",
      "This recent grant will do so much for so many, making positive and uplifting differences in their lives.\n",
      "“We are thrilled that we can continue to expand our programs to help even more individuals and families create a pathway to navigate their way towards an independent and thriving future,” Chamberlain says.  “In many ways the PRC provides hope that many have lost, especially after those few days and weeks after a traumatic injury or event. I am personally thrilled we were evaluated on our demonstrated impact, value and positive outcomes. The PRC has helped so many families; it acts as a lifeline when their lives have changed in an instant. The grant will keep that lifeline open for those who need it the most.”\n",
      "Chamberlain sums up the mission of the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation perfectly: “We not only are giving helpful tools (to clients), we are giving hope.”\n",

      "By Elsie WalkerThirty-five years ago, Terry Cook Delahaya USA in Chester started a car show that turned into an event like no other: Lead East, known as the world’s biggest ‘50’s party. The event grew to become a journey back in time to the music, dance, movies, and sights of the 1950s.\n",
      "After the last Lead East, Cook decided to retire to write a book. However, the party isn’t over. Four longtime Lead East attendees from the Hope area have taken ownership of the event and Jim Craig of Great Meadows has become event coordinator. With these changes, Lead East still features an abundance of classic cars, but it is morphing from a party into a festival of the 1950s, with more offerings for kids than in the past. Classic cars are still a big part of it, as is the spirit of giving. Lead East will run from Thursday, Aug. 30 to Sunday, Sept. 2 at the Parsippany Hilton.\n",
      "“We want to open the door to more generations and introduce other generations to the ‘50’s,” explained Craig. He compares attending Lead East to being beamed up to a spaceship and taken back in time. Things were different then. “In the ‘50s, everything was American; it was an American phenomenon,” he said.\n",
      "Lead East has always had the sounds of rock and roll bands and accapella do-wop groups, the look of ‘50s fashion like poodle skirts and greased back hair, plus a traditional prom and even Elvis sightings. Now, it is offering more for not only those who remember the ‘50s, but those experiencing it for the first time.\n",
      "Craig shared that people can learn about how to dress like the ‘50’s or to decorate their home ‘50’’s style. Country line dancing has been added to the dance lesson offerings. Craig noted that classic country was also part of the ‘50’s. For kids there will be Craigles the clown, a clown mobile, a flea circus, face painting, balloon animals and contests.  A model making contest will be open to both boys and girls, in two different age groups. The children will be supplied with model car kits and judged on who does best at putting one together. Another contest for kids is to see who can get the best greaser (greaser down hair) look.\n",
      "Of course, Lead East wouldn’t be Lead East without cars with 1,400 plus cars expected to arrive by Friday of the event. They come from not only New Jersey, but a variety of states. Also, they’re not all from the ‘50s. There will be cars from the 1930s – 1970s: classics, rot rods, muscle cars and more.\n",
      "One aspect of Lead East is that of giving. Every year, Lead East picks a charity to support and this year it is the Ashley-Lauren Foundation which helps children in N.J. who have cancer. There will be a booth at which 50/50 tickets will be sold.\n",
      "Also, as it has been for many years, Piccatinny Arsenal, from Dover, will be on hand showing some of its military vehicles and collecting toys for Toys for Tots to be given out to needy area children at Christmas. The Parsippany police and fire departments are also expected to be on hand with vehicles and taking donations.\n",

      "With teen suicide on the rise throughout the state, Senator Richard Codey (D-Livingston), recently unveiled a $1 million plan to combat depression and help educate people on mental health.\n",
      "On July 1, the former governor introduced a bill that will award a $1 million grant within the NJ Department of Education (DOE) for school districts to hire mental health counselors.\n",
      "The NJ Department of Health will determine which school districts are awarded grants. The DOE will report on progress by 2021. There will be specialized training workshops to non-licensed, auxiliary school staff who interact with students and a creation of a statewide “Teen Suicide and Depression Task Force” charged with developing additional methods to combat teen suicide and depression and report back to the state legislature by July 2019.\n",
      "“School workers such as secretaries, security guards and teacher’s aides need the tools and training to recognize bullying, early warning signs and symptoms of mental health issues, and the proper steps to resolve conflict and prevent potential disasters,” declared Governor Codey at a press conference at Liberty Middle School in West Orange in May.\n",
      "According to the New Jersey Youth Suicide Report, 2,731 people age 10 to 24 were treated in an emergency room for non-fatal suicide attempts/self-inflicted injuries from 2013 to 2015. Also, according to the New Jersey Dept. of Health, from 2007 to 2016, suicides among children ages 10 to 18 rose by 16.6 percent.\n",
      "“Too many young lives are being lost,” Codey said at the press conference. “New Jersey must act now to better equip all school employees to help identify at-risk students and prevent teen suicides and other mental health related incidents in their schools.”\n",
      "Codey and his wife, Mary Jo Codey, have been involved with mental health since 2012 when they established the Codey Fund for Mental Health. The organization’s goal is to educate people about mental health and provide quality treatment for individuals with mental illness.\n",
      "Mary Jo has dealt with depression and Codey has met with many parents who have lost kids to suicide, including Dianne Grossman of Rockaway, whose daughter Mallory took her own life at age 12 in June 2017 and Rachelle St. Phard, whose son Coby committed suicide in March 2016 at age 18.\n",
      "The governor has been surrounded by death most of his life. He is the owner of Codey and Jones Funeral Home in Caldwell, but noted that he has never seen so saw many young people die until recently.\n",
      "Codey feels that social media is a huge factor in teen depression and suicide. Instead of being outside with friends or being active, bullying follows kids home onto Snapchat, Twitter or Facebook, making their lives even worse, he said.\n",
      "With the recent suicides of designer Kate Spade and renowned chef, Anthony Bourdain, depression can affect anyone, he said. The governor hopes these deaths may get people to talk about depression.“The biggest thing for mental health is to overcome the stigma of depression,” he said. “Teenage suicide is not a comfortable issue for people to talk about.”Governor Cody Aims To Prevent Teen Suicide added by new_view_media on July 18, 2018View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "The Many Colors of Love: Engagement Rings Get a Makeover\n",
      "WeddingDollarsCYou can thank Kim Kardashian and Kanye West for setting the bar so high when it comes to getting married.The average cost of a wedding — sans a honeymoon — has now soared to more than $31,000, according to the wedding planning website TheKnot. And experts say the “images of celebrity wedding extravagance,” a la last year’s $12 million “Kimye” nuptials in Florence, Italy, are influencing couples’ spending choices.Another reason for the jump, experts say, are the engagement rings.“People want big rings like the ones celebrities wear,” says Jason Kordvani, president of product development at Davani (davanijewelry.com), a family-owned company specializing in colored gemstones that has an almost 50-year reputation for creating some of the most gorgeous engagement rings around.Obviously, you don’t have to shell out that much to have the wedding of your dreams. But with this being the prime time for popping the question — 39 percent of all marriage proposals occur between Thanksgiving and Valentine’s Day — there is one trend that’s become both a must and a potential money-saving opportunity.Personalization, experts say, is on the rise.Here’s what we mean:• The engagement ring. If you’ve been reading the glossies, you know that celebs like Elizabeth Hurley and Jessica Simpson are breaking from tradition and wearing engagement rings with colored gemstones. Not only does this take fashion to a whole new level, but colored gemstones have also become a way to customize an engagement ring. And while it needn’t be her birthstone — Simpson’s is ruby, but Hurley’s sapphire jibes with the month her then-fiance was born — the right romantic touch can make for the ultimate in personalization.“It can also be the month a couple met or her favorite color,” says Kordvani.Whether sapphire, emerald, ruby or some other stone, Kordvani notes, couples are also often pleasantly surprised to discover they can get a “larger, more important-looking ring at much less cost than a diamond.” Davani Jewelry itself offers styles ranging from the more affordable Davani Bridal to the show-stopping Luxury Collection.• The reception. The bad news here is that spending on cocktail hours jumped 7 percent. So think signature cocktails rather than an open bar.• The wedding venue. “When couples get married, they’re really looking for interesting, unusual details,” Lorin Holmes, co-founder of VermontWeddings.com told USA Today. All things considered, the $50,000 price tag to hold a reception at the New York Public Library— anything cultural or historic is also hot — makes the average venue booking fee of $14,000 a little less jaw dropping.For more information, visit www.davanijewelry.com.The Many Colors of Love: Engagement Rings Get a Makeover added by new_view_media on December 22, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "St. Virgil Group Helps Keep Morris Plains Cleaner And Litter FreeAs the weather gets warmer, groups will be spreading out across Morris Plains to pick up litter and recyclables that have been carelessly tossed along roadways and in parks. The first to participate this year were a group of twelve students from St. Virgil.\n",
      "The St. Virgil group uses their mini grant money to help fund their yearly trip to Appalachia to help do work in this very depressed area. Along with two adults the young people were out on a chilly and drizzly first weekend in April to scour Simones Park. They picked up seven large bags of trash and two large bags of recyclables.\n",
      "Simones Park, at the end of Mountain Way, has been adopted by the sixth grade students from Borough School that have pledged to go out and clean the park four times a year. But Simones Park is a problem area. Even with the Borough School group, extra clean-ups, like this one by St. Virgil, and the help of neighbors that live across the street, litter is a consistent problem. Banners in the park with the litter program logo “Pick Up Morris Plains – Keep Us Litter Free” as a reminder to visitors have helped, but not enough.\n",
      "Litter is unhealthy, unsightly, and can be a safety hazard. Simones Park not only has soccer fields and open areas, but also has a well-used playground, so that broken bottles and crushed cans could lead to injuries.\n",
      "Anyone can help stop litter by using the many recycling containers and trash cans placed throughout the parks, as well as all along the main street, Speedwell Avenue. There is also a recycling container placed across the street from the train station. But even more important, the attitude that causes people to litter must be changed. People tend to think that somebody else will clean up litter left in the street or on the sidewalk, especially in places where there already is a lot of litter or places where the sense of community pride is low.\n",
      "Morris Plains wants everyone to take responsibility for their actions and pride in the environment and the town – don’t litter, put trash and recyclables in their proper place!\n",
      "Morris Plains Councilman John “Jack” Doherty is the liaison to the Clean Communities and Recycling programs and he commended the mini grant groups saying, “We are pleased that so many groups come out during the year to help with litter pickups, but hope our residents will keep our town a “community of caring” and do their part.”\n",
      "The groups that participate receive grant funds from the State Clean Communities Program. Penny Manser is head of the Youth Ministry at St. Virgil and said that, “The mission trip we take each summer is ten days of working with the people of Harlan, Kentucky, the 18th poorest county in the United States. The families there are picked by lottery for help with roofing, plumbing, painting, ditch digging, sheet rock work, siding, clean up from floods or whatever is needed by these local families. It is our opportunity to truly work as disciples in the world, and to learn to be grateful for the gifts that we have.”\n",

      "Morris Arts recently opened a 15th exhibit, entitled Black, White and Green at the Gallery in Morristown.  Guest curator Katherine Murdock, the Exhibition Committee of Morris Arts and the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation selected works by several outstanding artists in New Jersey and New York.\n",
      "Inspired by the biowall, the vertical garden of living plants within the exhibit space, Murdock chose to focus the exhibit on plants and selected the title, Black, White and Green, to purposefully reflect that limited color palette as a means of unifying the exhibit. What is striking, however, is the richness and variety of the artists’ unique approaches to the theme – through their use of different media (collage, oil, cold wax painting, photography, charcoal drawings, wood sculpture, etc.), composition, and subtle gradations of color.As Murdock notes, “Casey Ruble’s paper collage illustrates a bundled bouquet of invasive plant species and Kathy Cantwell’s oil and cold wax on panel explores green color fields that resemble landscape. Richard Bottwin uses plant material as a medium and highlights the wood grain with stain and paint.”The public is invited to view this exciting exhibit, open Mon.-Fri. from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and by appointment, and will remain on display until Aug. 24.  Visit www.morrisarts.org<https://www.morrisarts.org or call 973- 285-5115 for additional information.Morris Arts located in Morristown is a not-for-profit organization founded in 1973 dedicated to building community through the artsBlack, White, Green Art Exhibit Featured In Gallery added by new_view_media on March 19, 2016View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Locals Volunteer To Build A Better Life In GuatemalaBy Cheryl ConwayBeyond the conditions many can relate to, outside the walls of what’s the norm, exists a world so difficult to imagine unless one visits and reaches out to help.In Guatemala City, 11,000 people- in which 7,000 are kids- live and work inside a garbage dump.“Most survive by picking through the trash to earn less than five dollars a day. Many find their daily food in the dump.”Just when all hopelessness is lost for these human beings living in one of the most impoverished areas , more and more volunteers are stepping up to assist and steer them to a better life. Some local people have become very involved and formed an organization known as Beyond The Walls. This month, 75 individuals are volunteering to visit the Guatemala City Garbage Dump to build houses, donate clothing and shoes and organize sport clinics.The non-profit organization started in 2007 at the Mendham Hills Community Church, although mission teams were sent out before.“We had been going to Guatemala for a couple of years,” explains Betsy Ahl of Morris Township, executive director of Beyond The Walls. “The church was sending mission teams. We asked volunteers to help raise money to help pay for trips, build houses. They’d raise more money and that would go toward projects.”In order to influence others outside the church to get involved, and to receive matching grants from volunteers’ employers, organizers decided to expand the church group to a secular, non-profit organization, explains Ahl.The idea to help the people of Guatemala dates back to 2005, when Mendham was named one of the top wealthiest places to live in America.“The elders of Mendham Hills Chapel thought this wasn’t how others lived,” explains Ahl, “so they asked the chairman of the missions’ team to find an area that needed help.”One of the poorest places in the world, the Guatemala City Garbage Dump, was identified by a church member and the idea to team up with the Potter’s House organization, with a mission to eradicate poverty, build houses, help others get business loans and establish community programs.“It’s a ravine right in the center of the Capitol City,” describes Ahl. “They’ve been filling it up with garbage for 50 years.”In their first mission, Ahl joined 26 others for four days. The group, after that, “could have gone to Africa one year, China one year,” but the group decided it was more important to “come back and form long term relationships,” says Ahl who has sponsored three kids in Guatemala in the Kids In Potter House Education Program, in which 50 kids are sponsored to receive an education. Ahl has been sponsoring these kids since they were in the first grade, are now graduating high school and will be supported through college.Church member and organization volunteer, Mike Rubright, 50, of Long Valley, is currently on one of three missions to Guatemala this month through Beyond The Walls. His ninth trip out there during the past seven years, Rubright and his daughter, Erin, are working in the garbage dump from July 18-25.Another one of his daughters, Emily, has gone on the trip seven times but had to miss this one. Youth volunteers must be starting atleast seventh grade to participate, so for Erin this is her third trip. Volunteers must contribute $1,600 each in order to participate, with funds going toward flight and lodging; and additional funds to supplies and building houses. Every year, Rubright sends letters and emails to friends requesting donations to help support his volunteer work.About 75 people have signed up through Beyond The Walls to volunteer during the three missions this month, with 10 people from the Mendham, Long Valley and Chester areas. The others are from areas throughout the country such as Florida, New York and Texas, who formed their own groups with Beyond The Walls.Rubright and his wife, Katie, have a niece who was adopted from Guatemala so their connection is even greater.“I do construction all day long,” says Rubright. “I had no idea what I was doing; I had no construction experience. Now I’m the person in charge of construction projects my week.“Everybody builds, everybody works; it doesn’t matter how old you are,” says Rubright, principal at the Woodglen Middle School in Lebanon Twp.“We build a concrete block house with a concrete floor,” he explains. “We mix concrete by hand; it’s the hardest thing I’ve ever done. The girls and women work harder than I’ve ever seen; they don’t stop.” A family that is getting a house built works beside the volunteers.“It’s not very big,” he says, with the homes about 15 feet by 15 feet,” the size of a bedroom. Homes are for four to five person families, and sometimes six to eight people.It’s like “nine people living in the size of your kitchen,” describes Ahl. Homes are built side by side and cost $5,600 to build.A completed house consists of one big room with one eight-foot partition wall that separates the bedrooms from “everything else,” says Rubright. “They have a toilet and a shower stall” in an area about the size of a closet, and they get “a big concrete sink” that can weigh up to 600 pounds, which is used for all washing needs such as dishes and clothes.Rubright also works under Guatemala masons who are very particular with how they want things to be completed, he says.“They tell us what to do,” says Rubright. “There are a lot of times we do things that don’t make sense; you can’t tell them they are wrong. That’s frustrating. If they tell you to put a hole in a concrete pipe with a hammer and nails, instead of a drill, you do it.”The homes that are being built for the people in the Guatemala City Garbage Dump is luxury compared to the “cardboard sheet metal,” dirt, chemicals, methane gas that surround them and sicken them while living in the dump and “breathing the trash.”These houses also provide shelter and protection for these people, says Rubright, as gun shots are commonly fired in the garbage dump.His goal during this one week visit is to build three to five houses with his group of volunteers.Potter’s House has built 110 homes to date, with 75 contributed by the volunteers of Beyond The Walls, says Ahl, who visits four times, about six weeks a year.In addition to building homes, the volunteers lead soccer clinics and donate uniforms, soccer balls and cleats as well as baseball clinics and donations of t-shirts; help at a medical clinic, vacation Bible school, and deliver groceries and visit families.Through their efforts, much progress has been made such as concrete roads, a community center built last year, education programs which is much needed as the average kid does not go past fifth grade in Guatemala, says Rubright.“A lot of families look at education as not important,” says Rubright. “A lot end up working in the garbage dump” as scavengers. “They make money picking out recyclables. People sift through trash looking through recyclables to see what they can sell” or “they are looking for food to eat it.” Parents stop sending their kids to school because they need their school age kids to watch younger siblings so parents can work.If they are not scavengers, they rely on the garbage dump to sell their own goods, like tortillas to the scavengers so they can eat, and even jewelry, says Ahl.“It’s just this culture of poverty,” says Ahl, with high unemployment. “Education is not a value, that’s the bottom line. Potter’s House tries to teach the value of education especially to the parents.” It also tries to teach the vendors who do sell inside the garbage dump to sell on the outside, says Ahl.“But without education, it’s really, really hard to move their way out of the dump,” says Ahl.Scavengers are even making less these days. As the economy declined, so did the value of recyclables, explains Rubright. For those working 10 to 12 hour days, they are making two to three dollars.While “there are guns everywhere, “Rubright admits that he feels safe when there.“The organization we are with is well respected,” he says, and they stay in a retreat center with accommodations like that of a motel or college dorm. “We are safe; every store has an armed guard,” and no one walks alone. “We have relationships with people. We go to the same neighborhoods. There’s more of a comfort level now. It’s a safe place- I bring my kids there I’m not in fear of our lives.”It is the desire to help others and the appreciation that brings Rubright back to the dump.He says, “If there’s really a God, why does he let that happen? We let it happen by not choosing to use our resources that way. I don’t think I could not go back. They have so little but they appreciate everything they have. We have so much and we want so much more.”They say, “This morning I lived in a garbage dump; now I live in a mansion.”Rubright admits, “I’ve learned more from them than they get from me. I’m a better person in Guatemala than I am here.”Also nice is the community bond shared by the volunteers.For the last five or six years, the same group of people have been volunteering. “Everyone enjoys each other’s company,” say Rubright. “We work hard all day, you come back eat dinner. There’s community; there’s no television, little internet, no cell services. It’s a lot what life should be like.”Like Ahl, the Rubrights have sponsored a girl there since she was eight; now she is 17. Through their support they have helped Jennifer Lopez Munoz continue to go to school and get an education.Rubright tells people, “I have three daughters in America and one in Guatemala.”“All the kids down there, they know when we come back,” says Rubright. “It’s humbling; it’s like family.” Volunteers bring with them bags of clothing and shoes for more than 200 kids.Beyond the Walls has helped other communities outside of Guatemala, such as Native Americans, homeless people in Dover and in Newark.Rubright plans to volunteer at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota next, which is known as the poorest place in the U.S., next to Haiti, from alcoholism and unemployment faced by Native Americans. “This was their country and they are at the bottom of the ladder.”Beyond the Walls is always seeking more volunteers, contributions for clothing and shoes, and financial support.Its next mission to the garbage dump is Oct. 24-31, with already 20 people signed up.Go to Beyondthewalls.org for more information. To volunteer, email gobeyomdthewalls@gmail.com.“I encourage people to go, go somewhere,” says Rubright, Long Valley softball coach for the past 14 years and former school board member. “Find something to do where you can do something for someone else. There are people everywhere who need something. You do not need to be religious. Some people think it’s a church thing – it’s people helping other people.”Locals Volunteer To Build A Better Life In Guatemala added by new_view_media on August 18, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "On Sun., Sept. 13 Macculloch Hall Historical Museum welcomes Linda J. Barth from the Canal Society of New Jersey (CSNJ) Barth will present a program about The Delaware and Raritan Canal (D&R). The D&R is one of the subjects of the current second floor gallery exhibit “Canals of New Jersey” which will be available to view prior to the presentation.Canal author and historian Linda J. Barth will introduce the people, the bridges, the locks, and the aqueducts that made D&R Canal work. This waterway, now a “greenway” and the centerpiece of a popular state park, transported men and supplies between New York and Philadelphia during three wars. Inventor John Holland used the canal to deliver his Holland VI submarine to Washington for its Navy trials, and luxury yachts, like J .P. Morgan’s Tarantula, cruised the waterway.For more than 170 years, the D&R Canal has meandered across the narrow waist of New Jersey and was one of the nation’s most successful towpath canals, carrying more tonnage in 1866 than the more famous Erie Canal. Johnson & Johnson, Roebling, and Fleischmann’s Distillery all had their start along the D&R. These days the canal provides the people of central New Jersey with both a water supply and a premier recreational facility. Today, the Morris Canal Greenway, a partnership between local communities and the Canal Society of New Jersey, seeks to preserve the surviving historic remains of the canal, interpret canal sites, and offer recreational opportunities to the public. In this presentation Linda will discuss the history and operation of the canal and how it is used today.MHHM opens at 1 p.m. on Sept. 13 and visitors who arrive prior to the 4:30 p.m. program can enjoy the “Canals of New Jersey” exhibit. MHHM has partnered with CSNJ to present this display of panels that tell the story of New Jersey’s two towpath canals, the Morris and the Delaware and Raritan. The CSNJ’s display is supplemented by objects including some from MHHM’s collection and information about Macculloch Hall founder George Macculloch who had the idea for the Morris Canal. The exhibit shares some of the stories of the workers and families who lived and worked on the canal, as well as other details about its construction using photographs and drawings, as well objects such as model canal boats.Tickets for the program go on sale from 1 p.m., no advance sales, and remain on sale until the presentation begins at 4:30 p.m. Speaker tickets include admission to the museum exhibits during the afternoon and a guided tour of period rooms, the last tour ticket is sold at 3 p.m. Speaker tickets will remain on sale until 4:30 p.m.The Museum’s second floor “The Civil War Through the Eyes of Thomas Nast” and “Canals of New Jersey” exhibits will remain on view until 4:30 p.m. The first floor “Thomas Nast: Unknown Works and American Icons” exhibit will close 3:30 p.m. – 4 p.m. in preparation for the program. Tickets to hear speakers are Adults $8; Seniors & Students $6; Children 6 – 12 $4. Members and children under 5 are admitted free.For more information call Karen Hollywood, Publicity and Programs Coordinator Macculloch Hall Historical Museum at (973) 538-2404 ext. 15.Linda Barth To Speak At MHHM added by new_view_media on August 16, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "An Evening with The Monkees\n",
      "Featuring Micky Dolenz and Peter TorkThursday, August 27 at 8 pm(Morristown) – Hey, hey it’s The Monkees, featuring Micky Dolenz and Peter Tork, coming to Mayo Performing Arts Center on Thursday, August 27, 2015 at 8 pm. Tickets are $49-99.When four young men were cast in the television roles of a struggling rock band inspired by The Beatles’ A Hard Day’s Night, few could have predicted the impact The Monkees would make on music and pop culture at large, an impact that still reverberates 50 years later.Assembled in Los Angeles in 1965 by Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider for the television series The Monkees, the quartet of Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith, Peter Tork, and the late Davy Jones brought a singular mix of pop, rock, psychedelica, Broadway, and country to their music. The show itself, meanwhile, paid tribute not only to The Beatles, but also to the comedy stylings of The Marx Brothers and Laurel and Hardy as well as the pop-art sensibilities of Warhol and the emerging San Francisco psychedelic scene.The Monkees’ first single, “Last Train to Clarksville,” was released in August 1966, hitting #1 and serving as advance publicity for their series, which debuted on September 12. When the group’s self-titled debut album arrived in stores a month later, it quickly headed for the top spot of the Billboard charts, where it would ultimately sit for 13 of the 78 weeks it remained in the Top 200. (Two decades later, in the midst of a new burst of Monkee-mania, The Monkees popped back onto the charts, bringing the total number of weeks to 102.)By the time the group’s TV series aired its final new episode on March 25, 1968, the Monkees had seen three further albums top the charts – More of the Monkees, Headquarters, and Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones, Ltd., all of which were released in 1967, staggeringly enough – while racking up several more hit singles, with “I’m a Believer,” “(I’m Not Your) Steppin’ Stone,” “A Little Bit Me, A Little Bit You,” “The Girl I Knew Somewhere,” “Pleasant Valley Sunday,” “Words,”  “Daydream Believer,” “Valleri,” and “Tapioca Tundra” all finding their way into the Billboard Top 40.After the series’ two-season run, the group went on to star in the cult feature film HEAD (co-written by Jack Nicholson) and a TV special (33 1/3 Revolutions per Monkee) while also continuing to record new material, but much as the ’60s gave way to the ’70s, the members of the Monkees eventually gave in to their individual musical interests and went their separate ways. for awhile.In February 1986, after MTV broadcast a marathon of The Monkees, Dolenz, Jones, and Tork reunited for a 20th anniversary tour, with Nesmith joining them onstage for the Los Angeles date of the tour, and in 1996, all four members of the group reunited for a new album (Justus) and TV special (Hey, Hey, It’s the Monkees).In the wake of Jones’s death on February 29, 2012, the surviving members of the Monkees reunited and performed a series of concerts. The shows were greeted with sell-out response and phenomenal reviews. Now, Micky Dolenz and Peter Tork carry on that tradition with a full evening of magic music and multi-media splendor, including clips from their Emmy Award winning series. Their new show features all of the Monkees hits, plus an intimate acoustic set and solo spots for each of the singers. An Evening With The Monkees is sure to please every fan of the band.Mayo Performing Arts Center, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, presents a wide range of programs that entertain, enrich, and educate the diverse population of the region and enhance the economic vitality of Northern New Jersey. The 2015-2016 season is made possible, in part, by a grant the New Jersey State Council on the Arts/Department of State, a Partner Agency of the National Endowment for the Arts, as well as support received from the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation, F.M. Kirby Foundation and numerous corporations, foundations and individuals.

      " Morris County Sheriff James M. Gannon has selected Kelley Zienowicz as the person to lead the Sheriff’s Office into the future. Kelley Zienowicz, a graduate of the elite FBI National Academy, will be promoted to the rank of Chief Morris County Sheriff’s Officer, the highest-level Officer position in the Sheriff’s Office Bureau of Law Enforcement. Chief Zienowicz’s promotion will formally take place on Sept. 3, 2019, during a swearing-in ceremony, making her the highest-ranking woman in the Morris County Sheriff’s Office and the sole female chief in Morris County. “I am so proud to announce the promotion of Kelley Zienowicz to Chief Sheriff’s Officer of the Morris County Sheriff’s Office,” Sheriff James M. Gannon said. “Chief Zienowicz has a temperament that motivates and energizes others. She is highly-educated, a graduate of the elite FBI National Academy, and a true leader with an impeccable work ethic.” “With Chief Zienowicz at the helm of day-to-day operations overseeing all divisions in the Sheriff’s Office Bureau of Law Enforcement, we will accomplish great things which the people of Morris County deserve,” Sheriff Gannon said.  “Not only am I proud to have the backing of the Sheriff, I know this is an important time for the agency as a whole. I hope to bring positive  motivation to the agency, from the top to the bottom,” Chief Zienowicz said. As Chief, she will be responsible for management and day-to-day oversight over the Bureau of Law Enforcement’s four divisions: Support Services, Protective Services, Legal Services, and Special Services, which includes the Crime Lab and Crime Scene Investigation Unit. Chief Zienowicz – who has received multiple awards, including the New Jersey Women in Law Enforcement Breaking the Glass Ceiling Award – will be promoted to Chief from her previous rank of Detective Lieutenant. Chief Zienowicz grew up in Chester and attended Villa Walsh Academy.  She earned a bachelor of arts degree in psychology from Boston College in 1999, and a master of arts degree in forensic psychology from John Jay College in New York City in 2003. She began her career with the Morris County Sheriff’s Office in 1999 as a civilian clerk-typist assigned to the Internal Affairs Section.  Within a year, she was hired as a Sheriff’s Investigator and in 2001, she attended and completed training at the Morris County Police Academy. Chief Zienowicz was first assigned to the Protective Services Division, which provides security and judicial protection at the courthouse complex. In August 2001, she was assigned to the Criminal Investigation Section – now called Crime Scene Investigation (CSI) – and spent 11 years in the Unit, assisting in multiple criminal investigations throughout Morris County. She was called as a witness for the prosecution in several high-profile criminal cases in Superior Court between 2003 and 2014. She was qualified as an expert fingerprint witness in the sexual assault trial and retrial of Andrew Pena, and testified about evidence in the murder trials of Jose Feliciano, convicted of murdering the Rev. Edward Hinds in Chatham in 2009; Anthony Novellino, convicted of killing his former wife, Judith, in Denville; and Carlos Rojas, found guilty of bludgeoning Esteban Hernandez Vazquez and leaving his body in the trunk of a car abandoned in Lincoln Park. Chief Zienowicz was promoted to the rank of Sergeant in April 2012 and assigned to the Legal Services Division as the Executions and Foreclosure Section Supervisor. That promotion was followed on March 1, 2016, by another advancement to the rank of Detective Lieutenant. She was assigned the post of Division Commander in the Administrative Division, overseeing Internal Affairs and the Special Operations Section. She then was transferred to the Protective Services Division in September 2016, where she oversaw the courthouse complex and operations and security at the Dover Probation Office. One of her most profound pleasures was her nomination to attend the 273rd Session of the prestigious FBI National Academy, a 10-week course of study in Quantico, Virginia, in the summer of 2018. Sheriff Gannon, who backed the nomination, is an FBI National Academy Graduate, as well. The FBI National Academy is a professional course of study for U.S. and international law enforcement managers who are nominated by their agency heads because of their demonstrated leadership abilities. The program provides coursework on intelligence theory, terrorism, terrorist mindsets, management science, law, behavioral science, communication and forensic science to improve the administration of justice in police departments and agencies. Upon returning from the FBI National Academy, Chief Zienowicz in September 2018 was transferred to the Special Services Division, overseeing CSI, Evidence Section, and the Bomb Unit. Assisting in the implementation of new technologies at the Sheriff’s Office, Chief Zienowicz was a member of the Evidence Unit start-up team for the BEAST evidence tracking system, guided implementation of the CivilServe civil process database system in the Executions and Foreclosure Unit, and coordinated use of the new Computer Aided Dispatch System within the Protective Services Division. Chief Zienowicz has logged a voluminous number of hours on training, including intensive courses on crash reconstruction, supervision of police personnel, shooting analysis and reconstruction, and interpretation of bloodstain patterns. She has received the Sheriff’s Achievement Award, Exceptional Duty Award, Unit Citation Medal, Professional Service Medal, Educational Achievement Medal-Masters Degree, Morris County Detective’s Association Distinguished Achievement Unit Award, and the NJ Women in Law Enforcement Breaking the Glass Ceiling Award, which is awarded to women who achieve a law enforcement rank of lieutenant or higher. Chief Zienowicz is a three-time Police Unity Tour rider and participates annually in the Special Olympics Torch Run.Chief Kelley Zienowicz Becomes Highest Ranking Woman in Morris County Sheriff’s Office added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Locals Volunteer To Build A Better Life In GuatemalaBy Cheryl ConwayBeyond the conditions many can relate to, outside the walls of what’s the norm, exists a world so difficult to imagine unless one visits and reaches out to help.In Guatemala City, 11,000 people- in which 7,000 are kids- live and work inside a garbage dump.“Most survive by picking through the trash to earn less than five dollars a day. Many find their daily food in the dump.”Just when all hopelessness is lost for these human beings living in one of the most impoverished areas , more and more volunteers are stepping up to assist and steer them to a better life. Some local people have become very involved and formed an organization known as Beyond The Walls. This month, 75 individuals are volunteering to visit the Guatemala City Garbage Dump to build houses, donate clothing and shoes and organize sport clinics.The non-profit organization started in 2007 at the Mendham Hills Community Church, although mission teams were sent out before.“We had been going to Guatemala for a couple of years,” explains Betsy Ahl of Morris Township, executive director of Beyond The Walls. “The church was sending mission teams. We asked volunteers to help raise money to help pay for trips, build houses. They’d raise more money and that would go toward projects.”In order to influence others outside the church to get involved, and to receive matching grants from volunteers’ employers, organizers decided to expand the church group to a secular, non-profit organization, explains Ahl.The idea to help the people of Guatemala dates back to 2005, when Mendham was named one of the top wealthiest places to live in America.“The elders of Mendham Hills Chapel thought this wasn’t how others lived,” explains Ahl, “so they asked the chairman of the missions’ team to find an area that needed help.”One of the poorest places in the world, the Guatemala City Garbage Dump, was identified by a church member and the idea to team up with the Potter’s House organization, with a mission to eradicate poverty, build houses, help others get business loans and establish community programs.“It’s a ravine right in the center of the Capitol City,” describes Ahl. “They’ve been filling it up with garbage for 50 years.”In their first mission, Ahl joined 26 others for four days. The group, after that, “could have gone to Africa one year, China one year,” but the group decided it was more important to “come back and form long term relationships,” says Ahl who has sponsored three kids in Guatemala in the Kids In Potter House Education Program, in which 50 kids are sponsored to receive an education. Ahl has been sponsoring these kids since they were in the first grade, are now graduating high school and will be supported through college.Church member and organization volunteer, Mike Rubright, 50, of Long Valley, is currently on one of three missions to Guatemala this month through Beyond The Walls. His ninth trip out there during the past seven years, Rubright and his daughter, Erin, are working in the garbage dump from July 18-25.Another one of his daughters, Emily, has gone on the trip seven times but had to miss this one. Youth volunteers must be starting atleast seventh grade to participate, so for Erin this is her third trip. Volunteers must contribute $1,600 each in order to participate, with funds going toward flight and lodging; and additional funds to supplies and building houses. Every year, Rubright sends letters and emails to friends requesting donations to help support his volunteer work.About 75 people have signed up through Beyond The Walls to volunteer during the three missions this month, with 10 people from the Mendham, Long Valley and Chester areas. The others are from areas throughout the country such as Florida, New York and Texas, who formed their own groups with Beyond The Walls.Rubright and his wife, Katie, have a niece who was adopted from Guatemala so their connection is even greater.“I do construction all day long,” says Rubright. “I had no idea what I was doing; I had no construction experience. Now I’m the person in charge of construction projects my week.“Everybody builds, everybody works; it doesn’t matter how old you are,” says Rubright, principal at the Woodglen Middle School in Lebanon Twp.“We build a concrete block house with a concrete floor,” he explains. “We mix concrete by hand; it’s the hardest thing I’ve ever done. The girls and women work harder than I’ve ever seen; they don’t stop.” A family that is getting a house built works beside the volunteers.“It’s not very big,” he says, with the homes about 15 feet by 15 feet,” the size of a bedroom. Homes are for four to five person families, and sometimes six to eight people.It’s like “nine people living in the size of your kitchen,” describes Ahl. Homes are built side by side and cost $5,600 to build.A completed house consists of one big room with one eight-foot partition wall that separates the bedrooms from “everything else,” says Rubright. “They have a toilet and a shower stall” in an area about the size of a closet, and they get “a big concrete sink” that can weigh up to 600 pounds, which is used for all washing needs such as dishes and clothes.Rubright also works under Guatemala masons who are very particular with how they want things to be completed, he says.“They tell us what to do,” says Rubright. “There are a lot of times we do things that don’t make sense; you can’t tell them they are wrong. That’s frustrating. If they tell you to put a hole in a concrete pipe with a hammer and nails, instead of a drill, you do it.”The homes that are being built for the people in the Guatemala City Garbage Dump is luxury compared to the “cardboard sheet metal,” dirt, chemicals, methane gas that surround them and sicken them while living in the dump and “breathing the trash.”These houses also provide shelter and protection for these people, says Rubright, as gun shots are commonly fired in the garbage dump.His goal during this one week visit is to build three to five houses with his group of volunteers.Potter’s House has built 110 homes to date, with 75 contributed by the volunteers of Beyond The Walls, says Ahl, who visits four times, about six weeks a year.In addition to building homes, the volunteers lead soccer clinics and donate uniforms, soccer balls and cleats as well as baseball clinics and donations of t-shirts; help at a medical clinic, vacation Bible school, and deliver groceries and visit families.Through their efforts, much progress has been made such as concrete roads, a community center built last year, education programs which is much needed as the average kid does not go past fifth grade in Guatemala, says Rubright.“A lot of families look at education as not important,” says Rubright. “A lot end up working in the garbage dump” as scavengers. “They make money picking out recyclables. People sift through trash looking through recyclables to see what they can sell” or “they are looking for food to eat it.” Parents stop sending their kids to school because they need their school age kids to watch younger siblings so parents can work.If they are not scavengers, they rely on the garbage dump to sell their own goods, like tortillas to the scavengers so they can eat, and even jewelry, says Ahl.“It’s just this culture of poverty,” says Ahl, with high unemployment. “Education is not a value, that’s the bottom line. Potter’s House tries to teach the value of education especially to the parents.” It also tries to teach the vendors who do sell inside the garbage dump to sell on the outside, says Ahl.“But without education, it’s really, really hard to move their way out of the dump,” says Ahl.Scavengers are even making less these days. As the economy declined, so did the value of recyclables, explains Rubright. For those working 10 to 12 hour days, they are making two to three dollars.While “there are guns everywhere, “Rubright admits that he feels safe when there.“The organization we are with is well respected,” he says, and they stay in a retreat center with accommodations like that of a motel or college dorm. “We are safe; every store has an armed guard,” and no one walks alone. “We have relationships with people. We go to the same neighborhoods. There’s more of a comfort level now. It’s a safe place- I bring my kids there I’m not in fear of our lives.”It is the desire to help others and the appreciation that brings Rubright back to the dump.He says, “If there’s really a God, why does he let that happen? We let it happen by not choosing to use our resources that way. I don’t think I could not go back. They have so little but they appreciate everything they have. We have so much and we want so much more.”They say, “This morning I lived in a garbage dump; now I live in a mansion.”Rubright admits, “I’ve learned more from them than they get from me. I’m a better person in Guatemala than I am here.”Also nice is the community bond shared by the volunteers.For the last five or six years, the same group of people have been volunteering. “Everyone enjoys each other’s company,” say Rubright. “We work hard all day, you come back eat dinner. There’s community; there’s no television, little internet, no cell services. It’s a lot what life should be like.”Like Ahl, the Rubrights have sponsored a girl there since she was eight; now she is 17. Through their support they have helped Jennifer Lopez Munoz continue to go to school and get an education.Rubright tells people, “I have three daughters in America and one in Guatemala.”“All the kids down there, they know when we come back,” says Rubright. “It’s humbling; it’s like family.” Volunteers bring with them bags of clothing and shoes for more than 200 kids.Beyond the Walls has helped other communities outside of Guatemala, such as Native Americans, homeless people in Dover and in Newark.Rubright plans to volunteer at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota next, which is known as the poorest place in the U.S., next to Haiti, from alcoholism and unemployment faced by Native Americans. “This was their country and they are at the bottom of the ladder.”Beyond the Walls is always seeking more volunteers, contributions for clothing and shoes, and financial support.Its next mission to the garbage dump is Oct. 24-31, with already 20 people signed up.Go to Beyondthewalls.org for more information. To volunteer, email gobeyomdthewalls@gmail.com.“I encourage people to go, go somewhere,” says Rubright, Long Valley softball coach for the past 14 years and former school board member. “Find something to do where you can do something for someone else. There are people everywhere who need something. You do not need to be religious. Some people think it’s a church thing – it’s people helping other people.”Locals Volunteer To Build A Better Life In Guatemala added by new_view_media on August 18, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Locals Volunteer To Build A Better Life In GuatemalaBy Cheryl ConwayBeyond the conditions many can relate to, outside the walls of what’s the norm, exists a world so difficult to imagine unless one visits and reaches out to help.In Guatemala City, 11,000 people- in which 7,000 are kids- live and work inside a garbage dump.“Most survive by picking through the trash to earn less than five dollars a day. Many find their daily food in the dump.”Just when all hopelessness is lost for these human beings living in one of the most impoverished areas , more and more volunteers are stepping up to assist and steer them to a better life. Some local people have become very involved and formed an organization known as Beyond The Walls. This month, 75 individuals are volunteering to visit the Guatemala City Garbage Dump to build houses, donate clothing and shoes and organize sport clinics.The non-profit organization started in 2007 at the Mendham Hills Community Church, although mission teams were sent out before.“We had been going to Guatemala for a couple of years,” explains Betsy Ahl of Morris Township, executive director of Beyond The Walls. “The church was sending mission teams. We asked volunteers to help raise money to help pay for trips, build houses. They’d raise more money and that would go toward projects.”In order to influence others outside the church to get involved, and to receive matching grants from volunteers’ employers, organizers decided to expand the church group to a secular, non-profit organization, explains Ahl.The idea to help the people of Guatemala dates back to 2005, when Mendham was named one of the top wealthiest places to live in America.“The elders of Mendham Hills Chapel thought this wasn’t how others lived,” explains Ahl, “so they asked the chairman of the missions’ team to find an area that needed help.”One of the poorest places in the world, the Guatemala City Garbage Dump, was identified by a church member and the idea to team up with the Potter’s House organization, with a mission to eradicate poverty, build houses, help others get business loans and establish community programs.“It’s a ravine right in the center of the Capitol City,” describes Ahl. “They’ve been filling it up with garbage for 50 years.”In their first mission, Ahl joined 26 others for four days. The group, after that, “could have gone to Africa one year, China one year,” but the group decided it was more important to “come back and form long term relationships,” says Ahl who has sponsored three kids in Guatemala in the Kids In Potter House Education Program, in which 50 kids are sponsored to receive an education. Ahl has been sponsoring these kids since they were in the first grade, are now graduating high school and will be supported through college.Church member and organization volunteer, Mike Rubright, 50, of Long Valley, is currently on one of three missions to Guatemala this month through Beyond The Walls. His ninth trip out there during the past seven years, Rubright and his daughter, Erin, are working in the garbage dump from July 18-25.Another one of his daughters, Emily, has gone on the trip seven times but had to miss this one. Youth volunteers must be starting atleast seventh grade to participate, so for Erin this is her third trip. Volunteers must contribute $1,600 each in order to participate, with funds going toward flight and lodging; and additional funds to supplies and building houses. Every year, Rubright sends letters and emails to friends requesting donations to help support his volunteer work.About 75 people have signed up through Beyond The Walls to volunteer during the three missions this month, with 10 people from the Mendham, Long Valley and Chester areas. The others are from areas throughout the country such as Florida, New York and Texas, who formed their own groups with Beyond The Walls.Rubright and his wife, Katie, have a niece who was adopted from Guatemala so their connection is even greater.“I do construction all day long,” says Rubright. “I had no idea what I was doing; I had no construction experience. Now I’m the person in charge of construction projects my week.“Everybody builds, everybody works; it doesn’t matter how old you are,” says Rubright, principal at the Woodglen Middle School in Lebanon Twp.“We build a concrete block house with a concrete floor,” he explains. “We mix concrete by hand; it’s the hardest thing I’ve ever done. The girls and women work harder than I’ve ever seen; they don’t stop.” A family that is getting a house built works beside the volunteers.“It’s not very big,” he says, with the homes about 15 feet by 15 feet,” the size of a bedroom. Homes are for four to five person families, and sometimes six to eight people.It’s like “nine people living in the size of your kitchen,” describes Ahl. Homes are built side by side and cost $5,600 to build.A completed house consists of one big room with one eight-foot partition wall that separates the bedrooms from “everything else,” says Rubright. “They have a toilet and a shower stall” in an area about the size of a closet, and they get “a big concrete sink” that can weigh up to 600 pounds, which is used for all washing needs such as dishes and clothes.Rubright also works under Guatemala masons who are very particular with how they want things to be completed, he says.“They tell us what to do,” says Rubright. “There are a lot of times we do things that don’t make sense; you can’t tell them they are wrong. That’s frustrating. If they tell you to put a hole in a concrete pipe with a hammer and nails, instead of a drill, you do it.”The homes that are being built for the people in the Guatemala City Garbage Dump is luxury compared to the “cardboard sheet metal,” dirt, chemicals, methane gas that surround them and sicken them while living in the dump and “breathing the trash.”These houses also provide shelter and protection for these people, says Rubright, as gun shots are commonly fired in the garbage dump.His goal during this one week visit is to build three to five houses with his group of volunteers.Potter’s House has built 110 homes to date, with 75 contributed by the volunteers of Beyond The Walls, says Ahl, who visits four times, about six weeks a year.In addition to building homes, the volunteers lead soccer clinics and donate uniforms, soccer balls and cleats as well as baseball clinics and donations of t-shirts; help at a medical clinic, vacation Bible school, and deliver groceries and visit families.Through their efforts, much progress has been made such as concrete roads, a community center built last year, education programs which is much needed as the average kid does not go past fifth grade in Guatemala, says Rubright.“A lot of families look at education as not important,” says Rubright. “A lot end up working in the garbage dump” as scavengers. “They make money picking out recyclables. People sift through trash looking through recyclables to see what they can sell” or “they are looking for food to eat it.” Parents stop sending their kids to school because they need their school age kids to watch younger siblings so parents can work.If they are not scavengers, they rely on the garbage dump to sell their own goods, like tortillas to the scavengers so they can eat, and even jewelry, says Ahl.“It’s just this culture of poverty,” says Ahl, with high unemployment. “Education is not a value, that’s the bottom line. Potter’s House tries to teach the value of education especially to the parents.” It also tries to teach the vendors who do sell inside the garbage dump to sell on the outside, says Ahl.“But without education, it’s really, really hard to move their way out of the dump,” says Ahl.Scavengers are even making less these days. As the economy declined, so did the value of recyclables, explains Rubright. For those working 10 to 12 hour days, they are making two to three dollars.While “there are guns everywhere, “Rubright admits that he feels safe when there.“The organization we are with is well respected,” he says, and they stay in a retreat center with accommodations like that of a motel or college dorm. “We are safe; every store has an armed guard,” and no one walks alone. “We have relationships with people. We go to the same neighborhoods. There’s more of a comfort level now. It’s a safe place- I bring my kids there I’m not in fear of our lives.”It is the desire to help others and the appreciation that brings Rubright back to the dump.He says, “If there’s really a God, why does he let that happen? We let it happen by not choosing to use our resources that way. I don’t think I could not go back. They have so little but they appreciate everything they have. We have so much and we want so much more.”They say, “This morning I lived in a garbage dump; now I live in a mansion.”Rubright admits, “I’ve learned more from them than they get from me. I’m a better person in Guatemala than I am here.”Also nice is the community bond shared by the volunteers.For the last five or six years, the same group of people have been volunteering. “Everyone enjoys each other’s company,” say Rubright. “We work hard all day, you come back eat dinner. There’s community; there’s no television, little internet, no cell services. It’s a lot what life should be like.”Like Ahl, the Rubrights have sponsored a girl there since she was eight; now she is 17. Through their support they have helped Jennifer Lopez Munoz continue to go to school and get an education.Rubright tells people, “I have three daughters in America and one in Guatemala.”“All the kids down there, they know when we come back,” says Rubright. “It’s humbling; it’s like family.” Volunteers bring with them bags of clothing and shoes for more than 200 kids.Beyond the Walls has helped other communities outside of Guatemala, such as Native Americans, homeless people in Dover and in Newark.Rubright plans to volunteer at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota next, which is known as the poorest place in the U.S., next to Haiti, from alcoholism and unemployment faced by Native Americans. “This was their country and they are at the bottom of the ladder.”Beyond the Walls is always seeking more volunteers, contributions for clothing and shoes, and financial support.Its next mission to the garbage dump is Oct. 24-31, with already 20 people signed up.Go to Beyondthewalls.org for more information. To volunteer, email gobeyomdthewalls@gmail.com.“I encourage people to go, go somewhere,” says Rubright, Long Valley softball coach for the past 14 years and former school board member. “Find something to do where you can do something for someone else. There are people everywhere who need something. You do not need to be religious. Some people think it’s a church thing – it’s people helping other people.”Locals Volunteer To Build A Better Life In Guatemala added by new_view_media on August 18, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      " Morris County Sheriff James M. Gannon has selected Kelley Zienowicz as the person to lead the Sheriff’s Office into the future. Kelley Zienowicz, a graduate of the elite FBI National Academy, will be promoted to the rank of Chief Morris County Sheriff’s Officer, the highest-level Officer position in the Sheriff’s Office Bureau of Law Enforcement. Chief Zienowicz’s promotion will formally take place on Sept. 3, 2019, during a swearing-in ceremony, making her the highest-ranking woman in the Morris County Sheriff’s Office and the sole female chief in Morris County. “I am so proud to announce the promotion of Kelley Zienowicz to Chief Sheriff’s Officer of the Morris County Sheriff’s Office,” Sheriff James M. Gannon said. “Chief Zienowicz has a temperament that motivates and energizes others. She is highly-educated, a graduate of the elite FBI National Academy, and a true leader with an impeccable work ethic.” “With Chief Zienowicz at the helm of day-to-day operations overseeing all divisions in the Sheriff’s Office Bureau of Law Enforcement, we will accomplish great things which the people of Morris County deserve,” Sheriff Gannon said.  “Not only am I proud to have the backing of the Sheriff, I know this is an important time for the agency as a whole. I hope to bring positive  motivation to the agency, from the top to the bottom,” Chief Zienowicz said. As Chief, she will be responsible for management and day-to-day oversight over the Bureau of Law Enforcement’s four divisions: Support Services, Protective Services, Legal Services, and Special Services, which includes the Crime Lab and Crime Scene Investigation Unit. Chief Zienowicz – who has received multiple awards, including the New Jersey Women in Law Enforcement Breaking the Glass Ceiling Award – will be promoted to Chief from her previous rank of Detective Lieutenant. Chief Zienowicz grew up in Chester and attended Villa Walsh Academy.  She earned a bachelor of arts degree in psychology from Boston College in 1999, and a master of arts degree in forensic psychology from John Jay College in New York City in 2003. She began her career with the Morris County Sheriff’s Office in 1999 as a civilian clerk-typist assigned to the Internal Affairs Section.  Within a year, she was hired as a Sheriff’s Investigator and in 2001, she attended and completed training at the Morris County Police Academy. Chief Zienowicz was first assigned to the Protective Services Division, which provides security and judicial protection at the courthouse complex. In August 2001, she was assigned to the Criminal Investigation Section – now called Crime Scene Investigation (CSI) – and spent 11 years in the Unit, assisting in multiple criminal investigations throughout Morris County. She was called as a witness for the prosecution in several high-profile criminal cases in Superior Court between 2003 and 2014. She was qualified as an expert fingerprint witness in the sexual assault trial and retrial of Andrew Pena, and testified about evidence in the murder trials of Jose Feliciano, convicted of murdering the Rev. Edward Hinds in Chatham in 2009; Anthony Novellino, convicted of killing his former wife, Judith, in Denville; and Carlos Rojas, found guilty of bludgeoning Esteban Hernandez Vazquez and leaving his body in the trunk of a car abandoned in Lincoln Park. Chief Zienowicz was promoted to the rank of Sergeant in April 2012 and assigned to the Legal Services Division as the Executions and Foreclosure Section Supervisor. That promotion was followed on March 1, 2016, by another advancement to the rank of Detective Lieutenant. She was assigned the post of Division Commander in the Administrative Division, overseeing Internal Affairs and the Special Operations Section. She then was transferred to the Protective Services Division in September 2016, where she oversaw the courthouse complex and operations and security at the Dover Probation Office. One of her most profound pleasures was her nomination to attend the 273rd Session of the prestigious FBI National Academy, a 10-week course of study in Quantico, Virginia, in the summer of 2018. Sheriff Gannon, who backed the nomination, is an FBI National Academy Graduate, as well. The FBI National Academy is a professional course of study for U.S. and international law enforcement managers who are nominated by their agency heads because of their demonstrated leadership abilities. The program provides coursework on intelligence theory, terrorism, terrorist mindsets, management science, law, behavioral science, communication and forensic science to improve the administration of justice in police departments and agencies. Upon returning from the FBI National Academy, Chief Zienowicz in September 2018 was transferred to the Special Services Division, overseeing CSI, Evidence Section, and the Bomb Unit. Assisting in the implementation of new technologies at the Sheriff’s Office, Chief Zienowicz was a member of the Evidence Unit start-up team for the BEAST evidence tracking system, guided implementation of the CivilServe civil process database system in the Executions and Foreclosure Unit, and coordinated use of the new Computer Aided Dispatch System within the Protective Services Division. Chief Zienowicz has logged a voluminous number of hours on training, including intensive courses on crash reconstruction, supervision of police personnel, shooting analysis and reconstruction, and interpretation of bloodstain patterns. She has received the Sheriff’s Achievement Award, Exceptional Duty Award, Unit Citation Medal, Professional Service Medal, Educational Achievement Medal-Masters Degree, Morris County Detective’s Association Distinguished Achievement Unit Award, and the NJ Women in Law Enforcement Breaking the Glass Ceiling Award, which is awarded to women who achieve a law enforcement rank of lieutenant or higher. Chief Zienowicz is a three-time Police Unity Tour rider and participates annually in the Special Olympics Torch Run.Chief Kelley Zienowicz Becomes Highest Ranking Woman in Morris County Sheriff’s Office added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "By: Michele DiPasquale To some, a library may be a thing of the past; but in fact, libraries are currently visited much more frequently than one might think. And public libraries can still proclaim that they are not only crucial to the populace for offering the enjoyment of reading for free, but for the very relevant and contemporary services they provide. In fact, a recent survey showed that, since 2016, 53% of Millennials say they used a library at least twice in any given year, and that number is actually higher when comparing it to 45% of Gen Xers and 43% of Baby Boomers who were simultaneously polled. So even in today’s online world, the public library is still absolutely in demand. Catherine Tinger GoldbergThere are public libraries for children, adolescents, teens, and adults, but the very first library for your very young child, is, in fact, First Library® of Morristown. At First Library new mothers and parents can borrow books and other materials, make use of reference collections, enjoy computer services, and encourage early literacy and the joy of reading.  “The idea to start First Library® came to me after my friend, Diane, had her first child. I wanted to give my love of reading to her and her newborn, so I sent her some books to read to her baby son, Lubin. Diane later explained that she was having a hard time finding English-language children’s books to read to him and that my books were the perfect gift for a new first-time mother (from the United States living in France). So I began sending her a new children’s book every month – many were childhood favorites of my own children. Diane would call or write to say how she, and later her son, happily anticipated the arrival of their monthly book and the joy they received reading it together, and how they both looked forward to reading time,” shared Catherine Tinger Goldberg, founder and director of First Library®. She felt that if a book could bring so much happiness, joy, and comfort to just one child, how much could it bring to multiple children? It was then that she decided to create First Library®. By taking a cue from Dolly Parton and her Imagination Library program, Ms. Tinger Goldberg followed Ms. Parton’s idea. The Imagination Library was created in 1995 for in-need children in Ms. Parton’s native Tennessee. The purpose was and is for each child, regardless of gender, race, or income, to register at the Imagination Library program and receive a free book each month until the age of five, paid for by Ms. Parton’s Dollywood Foundation®. While it began for children in need in Tennessee, Ms. Parton, by the year 2000, allowed and promoted the replication of the program to other states.  In order to promote local library patronage, First Library® became more than a free monthly book program. Ms. Tinger Goldberg devised a curriculum for first-time mothers in need that was tailored to their and their firstborn child’s special circumstances. The curriculum would give first-time parents in need the First Library® book program (or other books) and gently-used clothing and educational toys during their child’s first three years of life, free of charge, by requiring parents to read to their child daily and submit a reading log each month.  First Library promotes regular local library patronage and does not operate its own private, first-time mothers only, library facility.\n",
      " All requested library activities are to be performed at the first time mother’s home library. Also, although the three programs, First Library, More First Library and Most First Library are similar but differentiate themselves in the amount of activities required, all of the items we offer for selection by the mothers, except for the previously chosen new Imagination Library books, are brand new, not gently used. “All we ask is that parents read to their child daily and maintain regular library patronage,” Ms. Tinger Goldberg explained.  “Essentially we are a free book program but sometimes more than a book a month is necessary to bring the importance of regular reading and books into a home. For children born under the poverty level there are new educational toys and clothing available for the parents,” Ms. Tinger Goldberg said. “I feel it is so important for children to be read to early and consistently. Children should have a firm foundation for a lifetime love of reading, respect for literature, and an appreciation for all things the library has to offer. I hope I am achieving these goals with First Library®,” Ms. Tinger Goldberg explained. Because First Library is in five counties and growing throughout the State of New Jersey, aside from receptions at their offices, they rely on individual community members and Community Actions teams to spread the word about First Library’s mission and fundraising efforts. They do accept monetary donations on behalf of the donor’s community through Classy.org. First Library is also an approved charity of the AmazonSmile program. “What parents and other community members are starting to realize is that if we help all children, whether they are less fortunate or not, learn to read early and on a consistent basis, we are helping everyone in their class, school, and community,” she shared. First Library is available in Livingston, Carteret, Edison, North Brunswick, Port Reading, Sewaren, Perrineville, Cedar Knolls, Chatham Borough, Chatham Township, Green Village, Morristown, New Vernon, Whippany, Somerset, and Basking Ridge.  First Library Will Help Build Libraries of Babies added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "WeddingDollarsCYou can thank Kim Kardashian and Kanye West for setting the bar so high when it comes to getting married.The average cost of a wedding — sans a honeymoon — has now soared to more than $31,000, according to the wedding planning website TheKnot. And experts say the “images of celebrity wedding extravagance,” a la last year’s $12 million “Kimye” nuptials in Florence, Italy, are influencing couples’ spending choices.Another reason for the jump, experts say, are the engagement rings.“People want big rings like the ones celebrities wear,” says Jason Kordvani, president of product development at Davani (davanijewelry.com), a family-owned company specializing in colored gemstones that has an almost 50-year reputation for creating some of the most gorgeous engagement rings around.Obviously, you don’t have to shell out that much to have the wedding of your dreams.

      "(BPT) – Snacks, produce, drinks or sweets – if it is a seasonal offering, Americans are anxiously awaiting it. According to Nielsen, Americans spend about $374 billion annually on snack foods. For many of those snack lovers, items that are only available for a limited time are one of the major highlights of seasonal occasions and holidays, especially this time of year when, according to a recent Cheetos brand survey, 65 percent of Americans profess their love of seasonal Easter treats.Whether your favorite holiday arrives in spring, summer, winter or fall, seasonal treats can sweeten your enjoyment of the season. No one wants to miss the coveted special flavors and offerings that appear on store shelves for short stints and are quickly cleared out by that clever “seasonal snack stockpiler” who is always one step ahead of you. So here’s your guide to the top treats to watch for this spring, and throughout the year.SpringIt might still be too chilly to feel like spring in some areas of the country, but St. Patrick’s Day undoubtedly marks the start of the springtime snacking season. Milkshake lovers will kick things off with mint-green milkshakes, and quickly turn their attention to Easter candies and snacks.Chocolate and marshmallow sweets are the traditional stars of Easter baskets across the country – for both the young, and the young at heart. It is no surprise that 71 percent of parents who celebrate Easter admit to sneaking snacks from their kids’ baskets, according to the Cheetos survey.Of course, everyone is familiar with jelly beans, peanut butter eggs, chocolate bunnies and marshmallow chicks, but the majority of consumers say they desire more variety beyond just candy. This year, there’s a new must-try alternative to satisfy the search for something beyond the candy animal monotony. Cheetos Sweetos, the cinnamon-sugar version of everyone’s favorite cheddar cheese snacks is reappearing in stores — and Easter baskets — this spring, but only for a limited time. Launched in 2015, Sweetos snacks are the perfect, and delicious, twist on Easter snacking.SummerFrozen treats are the highlight of summer, but not just the ice cream quarts you find year-round in the freezer cases at your local grocer. Summer means the ice cream truck will be rolling through neighborhood streets, sounding that familiar melodic “come and get it” tune and serving up frozen favorites that you just can’t find anywhere else —  or at any other time of year.You can’t go wrong with the missile-shaped, multi-colored ice pops that beckon from beside a myriad of fruit-flavored cream pops, or reliable favorites like ice cream sandwiches and chocolate-topped cones. And don’t forget snow cones — the refreshing shaved ice in perfect spheres mounted on a paper funnel and topped with your favorite sweet flavoring!FallOf course everyone knows fall is pumpkin season — and you should take every chance to enjoy all things pumpkin-flavored this time of year, from coffee and ice cream to bread, cake and pie.However, autumn also heralds state fair season across the country — and the arrival of a variety of innovative sweet treats that can only be enjoyed among the unique surroundings of fair rides, tickets and games. Funnel cakes are a state fair staple, and what could be better when the weather gets nippy than enjoying lightly sweetened, deep-fried dough dusted heavily with confectioner’s sugar? Depending on where you live in the country and which fair you attend, you can find over-the-top sweets and snacks such as deep-fried ice cream, fried candy bars and even pretzel-encrusted brownies deep-fried on a stick.WinterOf course, winter holidays are the pinnacle of seasonal snacking. From the final weeks of pumpkin season to the eggnog, candy canes and baked goods associated with holiday moments from Thanksgiving through New Year’s, winter serves up a buffet of food and snacks that are available at no other time of year.Winter’s arrival means anticipated delicacies like gingerbread-flavored everything, bite-sized candy favorites that marry mint and chocolate in holiday shapes, and of course the much-maligned and equally beloved fruit cake all hit store shelves just in time to make the holiday party circuit!Whatever your preference — savory, salty or sweet — make sure to enjoy these snacking staples throughout the year. But remember that seasonal treats come and go quickly, so be ready to grab a bag of Sweetos snacks, remember to listen for the ice cream truck’s playful tune, try your state’s delicacies and fill stockings with enough gingerbread cookies or mint-themed chocolate drops to last through the end of the year!Don’t miss these must-have snacks that define each season of the year added by new_view_media on April 3, 2016View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Courtesy of Your 2nd LookHere’s a shocker: Up to 30% of radiology reports may not be correct or complete. Crunched for time, or lacking advanced sub-specialty radiology training, your radiologist may have misread your MRI, CT or PET scan, Cardiology CTA, mammogram, x-ray or ultrasound. So, you might not need that surgery after all. Or that drug.  Or that injection.Serious stuff, right?Wouldn’t another pair of professional eyes give peace of mind? But too often we don’t get second opinions. We don’t know whom to ask. Or we simply don’t want to second guess our doctors. Your 2nd Look Takes A 2nd Look, At Your Radiology StudyThis new web-based service, Your 2nd Look, makes it easy for patients to get another pair of professional eyes on radiology studies.Patients simply upload images to the website (your imaging center has to provide them upon request), and a radiologist will send a comprehensive report back within 48 hours. No computer? You can send your CD to Your 2nd Look and they will upload it for you, return it to you and pay your postage.Your 2nd Look radiologists view the same images but never see the first report. So your images are studied with fresh eyes.Your 2nd Look’s radiologists are chosen because of their many honors; some graduated AOA (Alpha Omega Alpha) at the top of their medical school class. Knowledge and experience matter in radiology just as much as in other fields of medicine, and Your 2nd Look assures you that you will have the best. Fees, which are not covered by insurance, are $69 – $249 depending on the type of study. Your 2nd Look offers military, veteran, clergy, senior (and all immediate family members) discounts, and is negotiating with membership-based organizations and retailers for group deals.One of the founders of Your 2nd Look shares a personal story. His 89-year old mom had had a series of strokes and the ER doctor, looking at her CT scan, thought there was no hope and did not see the value of giving her a clot-busting injection.  The son insisted on the injection and had a highly trained neuro radiologist read the CT scan. The second radiologist disagreed with the ER physician. It was a complicated case with the strokes located at the base of the brain, and this neuro radiologist spent the time to go through all the scenarios. It’s just sometimes not the way an 89 year old woman is handled in an ER room with all the pressures of the moment.  Well his mom recovered and lived a wonderful four more years with her son and her family. So for that family the use of a second radiologist (albeit a very highly trained neuro radiologist) saved a wonderful life for his family. As with other areas of medicine it is usually advised that the patient try to get a 2nd opinion. Certainly for cases involving surgery or major treatments and, now, radiology. Is it not worth peace of mine for a family faced with serious medical decisions? Be an advocate and always consider all of your options for yourself and for your family.For more information visit the company’s website at www.your2ndlook.com or email info@your2ndlook.com or call 833-226-3566. Your 2nd Look Takes A 2nd Look, At Your Radiology Study added by new_view_media on September 3, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      " Morris County Sheriff James M. Gannon has selected Kelley Zienowicz as the person to lead the Sheriff’s Office into the future. Kelley Zienowicz, a graduate of the elite FBI National Academy, will be promoted to the rank of Chief Morris County Sheriff’s Officer, the highest-level Officer position in the Sheriff’s Office Bureau of Law Enforcement. Chief Zienowicz’s promotion will formally take place on Sept. 3, 2019, during a swearing-in ceremony, making her the highest-ranking woman in the Morris County Sheriff’s Office and the sole female chief in Morris County. “I am so proud to announce the promotion of Kelley Zienowicz to Chief Sheriff’s Officer of the Morris County Sheriff’s Office,” Sheriff James M. Gannon said. “Chief Zienowicz has a temperament that motivates and energizes others. She is highly-educated, a graduate of the elite FBI National Academy, and a true leader with an impeccable work ethic.” “With Chief Zienowicz at the helm of day-to-day operations overseeing all divisions in the Sheriff’s Office Bureau of Law Enforcement, we will accomplish great things which the people of Morris County deserve,” Sheriff Gannon said.  “Not only am I proud to have the backing of the Sheriff, I know this is an important time for the agency as a whole. I hope to bring positive  motivation to the agency, from the top to the bottom,” Chief Zienowicz said. As Chief, she will be responsible for management and day-to-day oversight over the Bureau of Law Enforcement’s four divisions: Support Services, Protective Services, Legal Services, and Special Services, which includes the Crime Lab and Crime Scene Investigation Unit. Chief Zienowicz – who has received multiple awards, including the New Jersey Women in Law Enforcement Breaking the Glass Ceiling Award – will be promoted to Chief from her previous rank of Detective Lieutenant. Chief Zienowicz grew up in Chester and attended Villa Walsh Academy.  She earned a bachelor of arts degree in psychology from Boston College in 1999, and a master of arts degree in forensic psychology from John Jay College in New York City in 2003. She began her career with the Morris County Sheriff’s Office in 1999 as a civilian clerk-typist assigned to the Internal Affairs Section.  Within a year, she was hired as a Sheriff’s Investigator and in 2001, she attended and completed training at the Morris County Police Academy. Chief Zienowicz was first assigned to the Protective Services Division, which provides security and judicial protection at the courthouse complex. In August 2001, she was assigned to the Criminal Investigation Section – now called Crime Scene Investigation (CSI) – and spent 11 years in the Unit, assisting in multiple criminal investigations throughout Morris County. She was called as a witness for the prosecution in several high-profile criminal cases in Superior Court between 2003 and 2014. She was qualified as an expert fingerprint witness in the sexual assault trial and retrial of Andrew Pena, and testified about evidence in the murder trials of Jose Feliciano, convicted of murdering the Rev. Edward Hinds in Chatham in 2009; Anthony Novellino, convicted of killing his former wife, Judith, in Denville; and Carlos Rojas, found guilty of bludgeoning Esteban Hernandez Vazquez and leaving his body in the trunk of a car abandoned in Lincoln Park. Chief Zienowicz was promoted to the rank of Sergeant in April 2012 and assigned to the Legal Services Division as the Executions and Foreclosure Section Supervisor. That promotion was followed on March 1, 2016, by another advancement to the rank of Detective Lieutenant. She was assigned the post of Division Commander in the Administrative Division, overseeing Internal Affairs and the Special Operations Section. She then was transferred to the Protective Services Division in September 2016, where she oversaw the courthouse complex and operations and security at the Dover Probation Office. One of her most profound pleasures was her nomination to attend the 273rd Session of the prestigious FBI National Academy, a 10-week course of study in Quantico, Virginia, in the summer of 2018. Sheriff Gannon, who backed the nomination, is an FBI National Academy Graduate, as well. The FBI National Academy is a professional course of study for U.S. and international law enforcement managers who are nominated by their agency heads because of their demonstrated leadership abilities. The program provides coursework on intelligence theory, terrorism, terrorist mindsets, management science, law, behavioral science, communication and forensic science to improve the administration of justice in police departments and agencies. Upon returning from the FBI National Academy, Chief Zienowicz in September 2018 was transferred to the Special Services Division, overseeing CSI, Evidence Section, and the Bomb Unit. Assisting in the implementation of new technologies at the Sheriff’s Office, Chief Zienowicz was a member of the Evidence Unit start-up team for the BEAST evidence tracking system, guided implementation of the CivilServe civil process database system in the Executions and Foreclosure Unit, and coordinated use of the new Computer Aided Dispatch System within the Protective Services Division. Chief Zienowicz has logged a voluminous number of hours on training, including intensive courses on crash reconstruction, supervision of police personnel, shooting analysis and reconstruction, and interpretation of bloodstain patterns. She has received the Sheriff’s Achievement Award, Exceptional Duty Award, Unit Citation Medal, Professional Service Medal, Educational Achievement Medal-Masters Degree, Morris County Detective’s Association Distinguished Achievement Unit Award, and the NJ Women in Law Enforcement Breaking the Glass Ceiling Award, which is awarded to women who achieve a law enforcement rank of lieutenant or higher. Chief Zienowicz is a three-time Police Unity Tour rider and participates annually in the Special Olympics Torch Run.Chief Kelley Zienowicz Becomes Highest Ranking Woman in Morris County Sheriff’s Office added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "by Elsie Walker Halloween will soon be here.  Many times on Halloween, or around camp fires, stories of ghosts; strange, creepy or haunted places; and recollections of strange occurrences are shared.  Some people pass stories on from generation to generation until they become legend. However, others, like members of the New Jersey Ghost Hunters Society (NJGHS), investigate strange occurrences to see if there is a paranormal presence involved.  Recently, people from around the coverage area shared stories and sightings of local ghosts, rumors of haunted locations, and experiences with the paranormal. Members of the online, “You Know You’re From Roxbury Township….” group recalled ghost tales and scary sights.  One popular ghost story was the Hooker Man. It is about a ghost seen by the Succasunna railroad tracks. “The Hooker Man lost his hand in some freak train accident, and now searches for it with a lantern,” shared Mike Stark, Roxbury.   However, it appears the Hooker Man has not only been seen in Roxbury, but Netcong, Flanders, Chester, and Long Valley also lay claim to the legend. Cheryl McClung, a former area resident, who now lives in Georgia, shared, “At night, people see his [the Hooker Man’s] lantern bouncing along the tracks in Flanders on the west side of [Route} 206. Dawn Traetta Hair, of Florida, another former Roxbury resident, remembers the stories of the former location of the Church of the Mystic Light in Flanders.  The building is closed, but there had been claims that witches had hung chickens and have had seances there. People still stop by it, out of curiosity, if not scared away.Kim Howell Candore shared that there have been ghost sightings at her childhood home, “I was raised at 11 Meeker Street [in] Succasunna, next to the cemetery. There has been many spottings of two men in Civil War uniforms smoking, sitting on a tree stump in front of our old house,”   said Candore, who now lives in Tennessee. Candore remembers that the two churches on Main Street, adjacent to the cemetery, used to be a military hospital. Also shared, was that Roxbury has its very own “haunted house” in the form of the Halloween House, a tremendous display put on by the Heard family in Roxbury.Hackettstown is the meeting site of the NJ Ghost Hunters Society.  The society’s mission statement is “To search out definitive proof of life beyond the grave.  To provide paranormal investigations to those who request them, free of charge. To train those individuals, who so desire and become members of the NJGHS, in the protocols of professional, ethical and scientific paranormal investigating..” L’aura  Hladik Hoffman is the society’s founder and director. She is the author of Ghosthunting New Jersey, Ghosthunting New York City, and Ghosts of the Poconos and has a variety of presentations on the paranormal which will be given at area libraries this month  (listed on the bottom of www.njghs.net/presentations.html). Recently, Hoffman recalled stories she was told of two ghosts who are said to haunt Bea McNally’s (formerly Charlie Brown Restaurant).  In 1878, the place was the Clarendon House (hotel) and from 1926-1947 it was the Hackettstown Inn.  “The ghost girl appeared to a young girl who was living at the hotel when her family owned it. She snuck down to the kitchen in the middle of the night for some ice cream. When she was headed out of the kitchen and into the dining room to sneak back upstairs, she was met with this bright, sparkling light and out of the light stepped a young girl – about the same age of the girl sneaking the ice cream – and the ghost girl was dressed from a different time period and clutching her teddy bear. The ice cream girl screamed, dropped the ice cream and ran up to her room. The next day when her parents confronted her about the mess in the dining room, they did not believe her about the ghost girl she saw. However, a couple weeks later, the father saw the ghost girl, too.”As for the other ghost, Hoffman said there are various origin stories as to who he is. Most have to do with drowning. Two versions have him as a child who was staying upstairs and died while unattended in the bathtub.  Hoffman shared that in another version of the story, “A Lady of the Evening was distraught over unrequited love of one of her clients and she took a bath and drank a bottle of gin and passed out and drowned.” However, most seem to think the ghost is a child as they have got the sensation of someone wanting to ride on their shoulders or putting a small hand into theirs.Over the years there have been other stories of ghostly presence at the location, such as unexplained footsteps and, when there was a pool hall at the location, how when it was unlocked for business one day,  instead of the cleaned pool hall, cues, etc. were strung all over. In Pompton Lakes, Laura Jennings, a member of the historic commission there, shared about some caring spirits at the Schuyler Colfax house ( Hamburg turnpike, Wayne)  “Dr. Jane Colfax Young grew up in the house with her father (Dr. Richard S. Colfax) and Aunt (also Dr. Jane Colfax). Katherine Young, daughter to Jane Colfax Young, shared that she spent a lot of time in the home until he was ten years old. Both her and her father felt and saw things in the house that they are sure were the spirits of their ancestors watching over them. The Colfax family is one of the founding families in the area.”Jennings also shared that she had heard reports of ghost sightings at the Lenox School in Pompton Plains.Morristown has had its own dealing with the paranormal.  Pat Goodfriend, Membership & Volunteer Coordinator for the Morris County Historical Society shared a short 2016 article by Y. McGreevy on Ford Mansion. The mansion at the Morristown National Historical Park is over 200 years old.  Once the home of George Washington (briefly during 1780), the mansion drew the interest of Gordon Thomas Ward, a paranormal investigator, who in 2016, did a presentation on the Mansion and his two-year study of it, including the noises said to be coming from inside its walls.  An article by B. LaMuraglia the same year shows that during the time of his investigation, Ward heard the voices of three male and two female spirits.  None were Washington; Ward felt at least one could have been a kitchen servant. Bells Mansion, near the Netcong-Stanhope border has also been the subject of a paranormal study.  That was shared by Tom Lupo of Hopatcong, a producer who followed the NJ Ghost Hunters Society when it investigated the restaurant six years ago.  The segment includes a worker recalling seeing the spirit of a woman. He was cleaning up after the restaurant had closed. There are windows between the rooms.  He looked up and saw a woman, seated in the next room, looking out at the road. He watched her for about 10 seconds and then went to approach her. When he walked into that room, she was gone. This Halloween, will the Hooker Man or the little girl ghost at Bea McNally’s be seen?  Will voices whisper through Ford Mansion or the Lenox School? Perhaps, this year, a new spirit will be seen and its legend begun. Hauntings Around the Area for Halloween added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Unveiled earlier this year after several years of planning, the Center for Nursing Innovation and Research (CNIR) for Morristown Medical Center (MMC) is providing greater research and innovation.\n",
      "MMC holds the American Nurses Credentialing Center’s (ANCC) designation of a “magnet facility;” inspired by the ANCC requirement for its “magnet recognition program,” a formal plan to expand innovation and research resources via a specialized nursing center evolved. With support from the Women’s Association for MMC, the organizers were able to realize their vision this year.\n",
      "“We are grateful to the Women’s Association for MMC for the funding to support the CNIR,” said Carol Jones, chief nursing officer of MMC. “Within ten months of receiving funding the new space was built and utilized.”\n",
      "According to Jones, the primary goal of CNIR will be “improving patient and family outcomes related to the health and well-being of individuals.” This design will be accomplished by utilizing CNIR’s research capacity to find improvements in healthcare, researching best practices or by exploring innovative changes in care delivery. PhD-prepped nurses will be spearheading all research and innovative\n",
      "endeavors at the center.\n",
      "According to Jones, one benefit of the CNIR is more flexible scheduling. For example, two formal education programs for research and innovation are held annually at MMC; the classes now take place at the CNIR, facilitating participation.\n",
      "Additionally, the CNIR will hold classes highlighting new perspectives leading to innovations in the fall. An Evidence-based Scholar Program is also now held at the center.\n",
      "Jones pointed out the various ways that the CNIR will serve the diverse needs of nurses.\n",
      "“Frequently, there is a research component associated with academic studies,” said Jones. Nurses who are required to conduct research for academic purposes [can do so at CNIR], and seek guidance from nurse researchers at the center. Other nurses seek to learn about the evaluation of existing evidence or how to generate new\n",
      "knowledge through research.”\n",
      "The CNIR is open to any nurse working at Morristown Medical Center, and no special requirements are needed to meet with the nurse researchers about new ideas or research projects.\n",
      "“Motivated nurses are welcome and encouraged to utilize the resources and space!” Jones stated, adding that the formal classes on Evidence-based Practice and Innovation require an application due to limited class size.\n",
      "According to Jones, in the short period of time since the CNIR’s opening, nurses and physicians have provided favorable feedback. The frequent use of the space, including use by interprofessional teams for concept exploration and assistance planning studies has demonstrated the need for and desirability of the center.\n",
      "Additionally, members of the non-medical community who have seen the CNIR have shared their enthusiasm for nursing activities with Jones and her colleagues.\n",
      "Expressing hope that use of the center will continue to evolve and grow, Jones stated that nursing leadership at MMC will perhaps engage members of the community and area organizations, such as the Women’s Association for Morristown Medical Center, to collaborate on efforts of how to best serve the community.\n",
      "“Serving the community, as well as improving patient outcomes, are goals of the Atlantic Health System and Morristown Medical Center,” Jones said. “Nurse leaders at Morristown Medical Center have always been innovators!”New Medical Center Aims To Encourage Nursing Innovation added by new_view_media on August 22, 2018View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Congratulations! The college process is over! The applying, the application fees, the running around for recommendation letters. It’s all over. Now the whole family is probably running to the nearest Bed Bath and Beyond trying to find which comforter is the most “aesthetically pleasing” to the ideal dream college dorm. Before running for those necessities, come back to reality and realize that this isn’t the end of the worry.\n",
      "For most families, how much money college will cost is top priority because as years continue, the prices for schools climb. Have no fear, here are some ways for soon to be college students to save and make money to help them keep college costs as low as possible.\n",
      "Apply for federal work study Federal Work Study is a program most schools have in which students receive a job through the student employment office. The money that the student earns does not go toward their tuition but instead goes to the student as cash during the semester. Depending on the school, they allow students a certain amount of money to earn. Mary Primich of Trenton, a sophomore at\n",
      "Monmouth University double majoring in secondary education and English, works on campus at Pollak Theater through federal work study.\n",
      "“It’s hard getting a job when you’re in school,” she says. “It’s cool how we’re able to work on campus throughout the semester and get paid for it. I use a little bit of it for day to day expenses and then the other half I save some of it to pay off my loans.”\n",
      "Federal work study is also a great way for students to get involved with their school as well as making money.\n",
      "Apply for EOF\n",
      "EOF (Educational Opportunity Fund), is a scholarship that allows New Jersey students to receive a well-rounded education that they normally would not be able to afford. Given to those students more than capable of doing great things after college, chosen applicants are given full admission to the university that they attend, financial support, and services throughout the year to help them succeed during their next four years.\n",
      "Arina Martin of Jackson, a sophomore at Monmouth University majoring in music, is one EOF\n",
      "scholarship recipient. She states “EOF has given me the opportunity to go to college when I couldn’t afford it. Without it (EOF), I’m not sure if I would have been able to go to a university.”\n",
      "Be sure to check out the school’s website for their EOF program or call the school’s EOF department for requirements in seeking this financial help.\n",
      "Staying at home for school isn’t always bad\n",
      "Community college saves students money on food, room and board as well as other expenses such as room décor and transportation.\n",
      "Kassidy Orzechowski of Clifton, who recently transferred from Monmouth to go to Bergen Community College explains “I was supposed to go to Montclair but Montclair suggested I go to\n",
      "my local community college because getting your associates degree counts as having your general education requirements completed, so it makes more sense and it’s cheaper.”\n",
      "Although some may look down upon going to a community college, many would agree that these students are making a wise choice as the cost difference between a community college and a university is evident.Orzechowski explains, “I’m paying $2,500 to be a full-time student this semester instead of $16,000+ a semester. If I did this a year ago I’d be in a better position because no matter what all of my credits would have transferred so I’d be in a better position.”\n",

      "“Today’s Care, Tomorrow’s cure:” This is the inspiring mission of the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation.\n",
      "On July 1, the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation in Short Hills received a three year, 6.5 million dollar federal grant to help people who are living with spinal cord injuries and other conditions that cause paralysis. Some of these conditions include spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, (ALS), stroke, spina bifida and cerebral palsy. This money will aid these people in\n",
      "the many battles and challenges they face on a daily basis, enhancing their lives.\n",
      "The foundation is the recipient of the National Paralysis Resource Center cooperative agreement from the Administration for Community Living.   The Reeve Foundation has operated the Paralysis Resource Center (PRC) for approximately 16 years.\n",
      "Quality of life: Everyone strives to obtain it, the enjoyment and independence that make life worth living. So many people take it for granted.  But having quality of life is often difficult, if not nearly impossible, when people have physical disabilities impeding their way.\n",
      "But those from the Short Hills based Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation seek to change that. Their belief is simple: That every human being should be able to obtain and lead full and rich lives, regardless of their physical condition. They have an unwavering conviction that every human being deserves a life filled with\n",
      "dignity.\n",
      "Both Christopher and Dana Reeve were staunch advocates and champions for the disabled.

      "staunchly sought to give them hope, because he knew how easily they could feel hopeless.\n",
      "A staggering 1 in 50 people in the United States, approximately 5.4 million Americans live with paralysis of some kind. And those aren’t just numbers or statistics; they are people close to us. “We all know someone a brother, sister, friend, neighbor or colleague who is suffering with paralysis. They aren’t strangers. They are one degree of separation from all of us,” officials assert.\n",
      "The Reeves’ Foundation is dedicated to performing innovative research, securing grants, providing information and much needed advocacy to aid their clients.\n",
      "During the past 16 years and moving forward, The Reeve Foundation and National Paralysis Resource Center continue to compete in a rigorous bidding process for every three years’ worth of funding, but the results for their clients are golden.\n",
      "Since it opened in 2002, 100,000 people have been aided by this organization with approximately 20,000 people helped in the past three years alone.\n",
      "According to Anna Chamberlain, supervisor of Marketing and Communications for the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation since 2015, the Reeve Foundation has a dual mission.\n",
      "“We focus on creating resources and programs to help the 5.4 million Americans and their families impacted by paralysis though our Paralysis Resource Center while also funding innovative and cutting edge research to find cures for spinal cord injuries in the near future,” she explains.\n",
      "Offering a multitude of free services such as their peer program which offers a way of connecting individuals and caregivers with respective peer mentors to offer much needed emotional support, their military veterans program, information specialists, quality of life grants, program advocacy, and policy programs, these resources are designed to aid the whole individual.  They empower both the body and spirit, to help to navigate the insecure journey ahead.\n",
      "“The programs help individuals return to actively participating in their communities, achieving independence and self-sufficiency, achieving things we take for granted like learning how to drive again, going back to work and even leaving their own homes are also ways in which the PRC helps individuals every day.” Chamberlain enthuses.\n",
      "This recent grant will do so much for so many, making positive and uplifting differences in their lives.\n",
      "“We are thrilled that we can continue to expand our programs to help even more individuals and families create a pathway to navigate their way towards an independent and thriving future,” Chamberlain says.  “In many ways the PRC provides hope that many have lost, especially after those few days and weeks after a traumatic injury or event. I am personally thrilled we were evaluated on our demonstrated impact, value and positive outcomes. The PRC has helped so many families; it acts as a lifeline when their lives have changed in an instant. The grant will keep that lifeline open for those who need it the most.”\n",
      "Chamberlain sums up the mission of the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation perfectly: “We not only are giving helpful tools (to clients), we are giving hope.”\n",

      "By Elsie WalkerThirty-five years ago, Terry Cook Delahaya USA in Chester started a car show that turned into an event like no other: Lead East, known as the world’s biggest ‘50’s party. The event grew to become a journey back in time to the music, dance, movies, and sights of the 1950s.\n",
      "After the last Lead East, Cook decided to retire to write a book. However, the party isn’t over. Four longtime Lead East attendees from the Hope area have taken ownership of the event and Jim Craig of Great Meadows has become event coordinator. With these changes, Lead East still features an abundance of classic cars, but it is morphing from a party into a festival of the 1950s, with more offerings for kids than in the past. Classic cars are still a big part of it, as is the spirit of giving. Lead East will run from Thursday, Aug. 30 to Sunday, Sept. 2 at the Parsippany Hilton.\n",
      "“We want to open the door to more generations and introduce other generations to the ‘50’s,” explained Craig. He compares attending Lead East to being beamed up to a spaceship and taken back in time. Things were different then. “In the ‘50s, everything was American; it was an American phenomenon,” he said.\n",
      "Lead East has always had the sounds of rock and roll bands and accapella do-wop groups, the look of ‘50s fashion like poodle skirts and greased back hair, plus a traditional prom and even Elvis sightings. Now, it is offering more for not only those who remember the ‘50s, but those experiencing it for the first time.\n",
      "Craig shared that people can learn about how to dress like the ‘50’s or to decorate their home ‘50’’s style. Country line dancing has been added to the dance lesson offerings. Craig noted that classic country was also part of the ‘50’s. For kids there will be Craigles the clown, a clown mobile, a flea circus, face painting, balloon animals and contests.  A model making contest will be open to both boys and girls, in two different age groups. The children will be supplied with model car kits and judged on who does best at putting one together. Another contest for kids is to see who can get the best greaser (greaser down hair) look.\n",
      "Of course, Lead East wouldn’t be Lead East without cars with 1,400 plus cars expected to arrive by Friday of the event. They come from not only New Jersey, but a variety of states. Also, they’re not all from the ‘50s. There will be cars from the 1930s – 1970s: classics, rot rods, muscle cars and more.\n",
      "One aspect of Lead East is that of giving. Every year, Lead East picks a charity to support and this year it is the Ashley-Lauren Foundation which helps children in N.J. who have cancer. There will be a booth at which 50/50 tickets will be sold.\n",
      "Also, as it has been for many years, Piccatinny Arsenal, from Dover, will be on hand showing some of its military vehicles and collecting toys for Toys for Tots to be given out to needy area children at Christmas. The Parsippany police and fire departments are also expected to be on hand with vehicles and taking donations.\n",

      "With teen suicide on the rise throughout the state, Senator Richard Codey (D-Livingston), recently unveiled a $1 million plan to combat depression and help educate people on mental health.\n",
      "On July 1, the former governor introduced a bill that will award a $1 million grant within the NJ Department of Education (DOE) for school districts to hire mental health counselors.\n",
      "The NJ Department of Health will determine which school districts are awarded grants. The DOE will report on progress by 2021. There will be specialized training workshops to non-licensed, auxiliary school staff who interact with students and a creation of a statewide “Teen Suicide and Depression Task Force” charged with developing additional methods to combat teen suicide and depression and report back to the state legislature by July 2019.\n",
      "“School workers such as secretaries, security guards and teacher’s aides need the tools and training to recognize bullying, early warning signs and symptoms of mental health issues, and the proper steps to resolve conflict and prevent potential disasters,” declared Governor Codey at a press conference at Liberty Middle School in West Orange in May.\n",
      "According to the New Jersey Youth Suicide Report, 2,731 people age 10 to 24 were treated in an emergency room for non-fatal suicide attempts/self-inflicted injuries from 2013 to 2015. Also, according to the New Jersey Dept. of Health, from 2007 to 2016, suicides among children ages 10 to 18 rose by 16.6 percent.\n",
      "“Too many young lives are being lost,” Codey said at the press conference. “New Jersey must act now to better equip all school employees to help identify at-risk students and prevent teen suicides and other mental health related incidents in their schools.”\n",
      "Codey and his wife, Mary Jo Codey, have been involved with mental health since 2012 when they established the Codey Fund for Mental Health. The organization’s goal is to educate people about mental health and provide quality treatment for individuals with mental illness.\n",
      "Mary Jo has dealt with depression and Codey has met with many parents who have lost kids to suicide, including Dianne Grossman of Rockaway, whose daughter Mallory took her own life at age 12 in June 2017 and Rachelle St. Phard, whose son Coby committed suicide in March 2016 at age 18.\n",
      "The governor has been surrounded by death most of his life. He is the owner of Codey and Jones Funeral Home in Caldwell, but noted that he has never seen so saw many young people die until recently.\n",
      "Codey feels that social media is a huge factor in teen depression and suicide. Instead of being outside with friends or being active, bullying follows kids home onto Snapchat, Twitter or Facebook, making their lives even worse, he said.\n",
      "With the recent suicides of designer Kate Spade and renowned chef, Anthony Bourdain, depression can affect anyone, he said. The governor hopes these deaths may get people to talk about depression.“The biggest thing for mental health is to overcome the stigma of depression,” he said. “Teenage suicide is not a comfortable issue for people to talk about.”Governor Cody Aims To Prevent Teen Suicide added by new_view_media on July 18, 2018View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "The Many Colors of Love: Engagement Rings Get a Makeover\n",
      "WeddingDollarsCYou can thank Kim Kardashian and Kanye West for setting the bar so high when it comes to getting married.The average cost of a wedding — sans a honeymoon — has now soared to more than $31,000, according to the wedding planning website TheKnot. And experts say the “images of celebrity wedding extravagance,” a la last year’s $12 million “Kimye” nuptials in Florence, Italy, are influencing couples’ spending choices.Another reason for the jump, experts say, are the engagement rings.“People want big rings like the ones celebrities wear,” says Jason Kordvani, president of product development at Davani (davanijewelry.com), a family-owned company specializing in colored gemstones that has an almost 50-year reputation for creating some of the most gorgeous engagement rings around.Obviously, you don’t have to shell out that much to have the wedding of your dreams. But with this being the prime time for popping the question — 39 percent of all marriage proposals occur between Thanksgiving and Valentine’s Day — there is one trend that’s become both a must and a potential money-saving opportunity.Personalization, experts say, is on the rise.Here’s what we mean:• The engagement ring. If you’ve been reading the glossies, you know that celebs like Elizabeth Hurley and Jessica Simpson are breaking from tradition and wearing engagement rings with colored gemstones. Not only does this take fashion to a whole new level, but colored gemstones have also become a way to customize an engagement ring. And while it needn’t be her birthstone — Simpson’s is ruby, but Hurley’s sapphire jibes with the month her then-fiance was born — the right romantic touch can make for the ultimate in personalization.“It can also be the month a couple met or her favorite color,” says Kordvani.Whether sapphire, emerald, ruby or some other stone, Kordvani notes, couples are also often pleasantly surprised to discover they can get a “larger, more important-looking ring at much less cost than a diamond.” Davani Jewelry itself offers styles ranging from the more affordable Davani Bridal to the show-stopping Luxury Collection.• The reception. The bad news here is that spending on cocktail hours jumped 7 percent. So think signature cocktails rather than an open bar.• The wedding venue. “When couples get married, they’re really looking for interesting, unusual details,” Lorin Holmes, co-founder of VermontWeddings.com told USA Today. All things considered, the $50,000 price tag to hold a reception at the New York Public Library— anything cultural or historic is also hot — makes the average venue booking fee of $14,000 a little less jaw dropping.For more information, visit www.davanijewelry.com.The Many Colors of Love: Engagement Rings Get a Makeover added by new_view_media on December 22, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Morris County Historical Society is pleased to announce the receipt of two 2019 Grants for Historic Preservation from the Morris County Board of Chosen Freeholders. The Freeholders approved the funding based upon the recommendation of the Morris County Historic Preservation Trust Fund Review Board, which reviewed 29 applications.  MCHS was awarded $140,980 for construction of Phase I of the roof restoration and structural stabilization of the carriage house. Funds will cover costs associated with replacement of the collar ties, restoration of the original roof and gutter system, restoration of exterior woodwork, including the cupola, and stabilization of the north and south walls.MCHS was also awarded $10,175 for constructions documents to guide Phase II of the restoration and interior rehabilitation of the carriage house, which will focus on preparing the carriage house to be opened to the public and interpreted as an example of an active and productive gentleman’s farm.These funds are being combined with funds awarded by the New Jersey Historic Trust in 2017. The combined cost of the Phase I construction project, over $315,000, represents roughly 66% of the total cost of the restoration of the structure. MCHS is extremely grateful to the Morris County Historic Preservation Trust and the New Jersey Historic Trust Fund for supporting the restoration efforts of this unique and historically significant structure. Acorn Hall’s carriage house was constructed as part of the Italianate country residence in 1853 and expanded in 1860. It represents a mid-19th century utilitarian carriage house used in the process of farming, orchard tending, and small animal husbandry on the once 9-acre property.MCHS is located at Acorn Hall, 68 Morris Ave., Morristown, and is open Wednesdays and Thursdays, 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., and Sundays, 1-4 p.m. Admission, which includes the exhibits and landscaped grounds, is $6 for adults, $5 for seniors, $3 for students, and is free for children under 12 and MCHS members.  For more information, call MCHS at 973-267-3465 or visit the MCHS website: MorrisCountyHistory.org.MCHS is looking forward to the Carriage House being consistently open and available to the public, for the first time ever, as we continue our efforts to promote and preserve the history of both Acorn Hall and its associated landscape within the context of Morristown and New Jersey.Founded in 1945, MCHS is a member-supported 501 (c)3 organization whose mission is to preserve and promote the history of Morris County.Morris County Historical Society Awarded Grants for Acorn Hall Carriage House Renovation added by new_view_media on September 3, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "By Jerry Del Priore  On September 13th, the Mayo Performing Arts Center (MPAC) kicked off its 25th anniversary with a fabulous concert by singer/actress and American Idol finalist Katherine McPhee. MPAC, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, has been at the center of Morristown’s revitalization and is a major reason why it’s a nightlife hotspot today, with several wonderful bars and restaurants lining its lively streets since its inception, according to General Manager Ed Kirchdoerffer. “Twenty-five years ago, Morristown wasn’t the popular town it is now,” Kirchdoerffer, a Morristown native, said. “We feel the opening of the performing arts center was part of the rebuilding of Morristown. It’s been an anchor for improvement.” Top musical and comedic acts have performed at MPAC over the years, from Foreigner and Daughtry to Melissa Ethridge and Wayne Brady, and every great entertainer in between. Moreover, MPAC doesn’t have any plans of slowing down any time soon. Musical performers such as America, Kenny G, Joan Jett and the Blackhearts and Ruben Studdard will be hitting the stage in October. “We feel we’re still in a growth cycle,” Kirchdoerffer said. “We constantly challenge ourselves to grow and invest in ourselves to make the best possible events.”  Kirchdoerffer said some of the ways MPAC will be celebrating its 25 years in Morristown are by holding a few free concerts, ask its performance-goers, on social media, to name their favorite moments since its opening, and have a number of $25 ticket offers, to name a few.  However, MPAC is more than a concert hall for some of today’s greatest acts. It also offers a Performing Arts School (PAS), founded in 2006, which now serves approximately 700 students per year with over 20 classes a week within a supportive and creative atmosphere. Students ages five to 18 come from all over Northern New Jersey to learn performance technique while building confidence and having a great time. Classes are offered in musical theatre, acting, singing technique, song presentation, improvisation, private voice and adult cabaret. “The emphasis isn’t placed on being a star,” Kirchdoerffer explained. “It’s placed on being part of a team, being part of the creative process. They really get a full immersive experience. Everyone’s so encouraging of everyone else.” While most of the kids don’t enter the entertainment world, Kirchdoerffer noted that they will gain valuable skills that will help them succeed in life. “Most won’t go on to become performers,” he said, “but they will learn important life skills that will go a long way, whether it’s in the boardroom or other areas of work.”Additionally, MPAC offers The Miracle Project, a fully inclusive music and theatre program for children with autism of all levels. “It’s been a very powerful program,” Kirchdoerffer said. “This is a program that grew organically. Many parents have spoken about (their experiences) and are happy to see their kids enjoy themselves. This (program) gives them a safe haven. They get to have fun while being themselves.” There’s also an Art Upstairs Gallery, located in the balcony lobby of MPAC, which showcases visual artists from a variety of disciplines, including watercolor, oils, photography, sculpture and more. Each year, the works of over 200 artists are showcased in group exhibits. Each display hangs from six to eight weeks.With all the success MPAC has experienced over the last 25 years, Kirchdoerffer said he hopes to see more prosperous years ahead for the Morristown institution, which has been a staple in the thriving town. “We have been here for 25 years and hope to do it for 25 more years and beyond,” he said. “It’s been the town’s heartbeat.” For more information on MPAC’s educational programs, Art Upstairs Gallery, and a list of upcoming performances, go to www.mayoarts.org. Mayo Performing Arts Center Celebrates 25 Years of Prosperity  added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "By Henry M. HoldenThe Morristown Festival of Books is an annual two-day event that takes place this year on October 11 and 12. According to Rachel Barry, Director of the Morristown Festival of Books, “The 6-year-old event is modeled after successful book festivals in other communities throughout the world. Each autumn, the festival brings together authors with readers and book lovers. The Festival is New Jersey’s premier book festival, celebrating the written word’s power to challenge, transport and transform.” Barry says the festival is growing each year. “We started with about 1,500 visitors six years ago and last year we hosted over 8,000.”The opening night is a ticketed Keynote Event featuring Preet Bharara who served as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York from 2009 to 2017. In 2017, Bharara joined the NYU School of Law faculty as a Distinguished Scholar in Residence. Bharara will speak on Friday evening at the Mayo Performing Arts Center at 7:30pm. Tickets will be available through the MPAC box office and on the festival website. Tickets are also available at the door on the night of the event, as availability allows.The Main Festival takes place all day on Saturday (10 a.m. – 5 p.m.), rain or shine.This year’s festival features more than 50 authors. Author selections featuring various genres are designed to appeal to a variety of ages and reading interests. “Authors will be speaking and answering questions in informal one-hour indoor sessions at five festival venues throughout the day,” said Barry. “Immediately following his or her talk, you will have the opportunity to speak with your favorite authors and have your books personalized at the Author Signing Tent, on the Vail Mansion lawn.” These sessions are free, no tickets required; general seating is on a first-come, first-served basis. There will also be portable restrooms at the Vail Mansion lawn. “The Festival center is on the lawn in front of the historic Vail Mansion (110 South Street), where there is an Information Tent, a Book Tent selling copies of the visiting authors’ books, the Signing Tent where authors will greet visitors and sign books, and concession stands selling refreshments.”“This year’s closing event is an exciting interactive event called Pitchapalooza,” said Barry. “It’s like American Idol for books (only without Simon). Anyone with an idea for a book has the chance to pitch it to a panel of judges. But they get only one minute.”The hosts, Arielle Eckstut and David Henry Sterry (a.k.a. The Book Doctors) team up with guest industry insiders to form the judging panel. The Judges critique everything from idea to style to potential in the marketplace and much more. Whether potential authors pitch themselves, or simply listen to trained professionals critique each presentation, Pitchapaloozas are educational and entertaining for all. All attendees come away with concrete advice on how to improve their pitch as well as a greater understanding of the ins and outs of the publishing industry.At the end of each Pitchapalooza, the judges come together to pick a winner. That winner receives an introduction by Eckstut and Sterry to an agent or publisher who is appropriate for their work. The Festival audience will also have a chance to pick a winning pitch. That Audience Choice winner will be voted on by the audience and will receive a 30-minute phone consultation from Eckstut and Sterry (a $150 value).KidFest @ MFOB includes author talks, signings, and fun activities all day for children up to 12 years old. Additionally, concessions will be available in the KidFest outdoor area outside the Presbyterian Church Parish House at 65 South Street. Please note, the festival is not held on the Morristown Green. There are several public parking garages within walking distance of the Festival center. This is a casual event. Wear comfortable walking shoes and be prepared for cool weather. It is a rain or shine event, so please bring an umbrella if the day’s weather warrants it. For more information and a list of authors attending see: www.morristownbooks.orgThe Morristown Festival of Books is Back added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "By: Michele DiPasquale To some, a library may be a thing of the past; but in fact, libraries are currently visited much more frequently than one might think. And public libraries can still proclaim that they are not only crucial to the populace for offering the enjoyment of reading for free, but for the very relevant and contemporary services they provide. In fact, a recent survey showed that, since 2016, 53% of Millennials say they used a library at least twice in any given year, and that number is actually higher when comparing it to 45% of Gen Xers and 43% of Baby Boomers who were simultaneously polled. So even in today’s online world, the public library is still absolutely in demand. Catherine Tinger GoldbergThere are public libraries for children, adolescents, teens, and adults, but the very first library for your very young child, is, in fact, First Library® of Morristown. At First Library new mothers and parents can borrow books and other materials, make use of reference collections, enjoy computer services, and encourage early literacy and the joy of reading.  “The idea to start First Library® came to me after my friend, Diane, had her first child. I wanted to give my love of reading to her and her newborn, so I sent her some books to read to her baby son, Lubin. Diane later explained that she was having a hard time finding English-language children’s books to read to him and that my books were the perfect gift for a new first-time mother (from the United States living in France). So I began sending her a new children’s book every month – many were childhood favorites of my own children. Diane would call or write to say how she, and later her son, happily anticipated the arrival of their monthly book and the joy they received reading it together, and how they both looked forward to reading time,” shared Catherine Tinger Goldberg, founder and director of First Library®. She felt that if a book could bring so much happiness, joy, and comfort to just one child, how much could it bring to multiple children? It was then that she decided to create First Library®. By taking a cue from Dolly Parton and her Imagination Library program, Ms. Tinger Goldberg followed Ms. Parton’s idea. The Imagination Library was created in 1995 for in-need children in Ms. Parton’s native Tennessee. The purpose was and is for each child, regardless of gender, race, or income, to register at the Imagination Library program and receive a free book each month until the age of five, paid for by Ms. Parton’s Dollywood Foundation®. While it began for children in need in Tennessee, Ms. Parton, by the year 2000, allowed and promoted the replication of the program to other states.  In order to promote local library patronage, First Library® became more than a free monthly book program. Ms. Tinger Goldberg devised a curriculum for first-time mothers in need that was tailored to their and their firstborn child’s special circumstances. The curriculum would give first-time parents in need the First Library® book program (or other books) and gently-used clothing and educational toys during their child’s first three years of life, free of charge, by requiring parents to read to their child daily and submit a reading log each month.  First Library promotes regular local library patronage and does not operate its own private, first-time mothers only, library facility.\n",
      " All requested library activities are to be performed at the first time mother’s home library. Also, although the three programs, First Library, More First Library and Most First Library are similar but differentiate themselves in the amount of activities required, all of the items we offer for selection by the mothers, except for the previously chosen new Imagination Library books, are brand new, not gently used. “All we ask is that parents read to their child daily and maintain regular library patronage,” Ms. Tinger Goldberg explained.  “Essentially we are a free book program but sometimes more than a book a month is necessary to bring the importance of regular reading and books into a home. For children born under the poverty level there are new educational toys and clothing available for the parents,” Ms. Tinger Goldberg said. “I feel it is so important for children to be read to early and consistently. Children should have a firm foundation for a lifetime love of reading, respect for literature, and an appreciation for all things the library has to offer. I hope I am achieving these goals with First Library®,” Ms. Tinger Goldberg explained. Because First Library is in five counties and growing throughout the State of New Jersey, aside from receptions at their offices, they rely on individual community members and Community Actions teams to spread the word about First Library’s mission and fundraising efforts. They do accept monetary donations on behalf of the donor’s community through Classy.org. First Library is also an approved charity of the AmazonSmile program. “What parents and other community members are starting to realize is that if we help all children, whether they are less fortunate or not, learn to read early and on a consistent basis, we are helping everyone in their class, school, and community,” she shared. First Library is available in Livingston, Carteret, Edison, North Brunswick, Port Reading, Sewaren, Perrineville, Cedar Knolls, Chatham Borough, Chatham Township, Green Village, Morristown, New Vernon, Whippany, Somerset, and Basking Ridge.  First Library Will Help Build Libraries of Babies added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "How To Combat Cold And Flu(NAPSI)—According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), chances are good you’ll get a cold or the flu this year. Adults have an average of two to three colds per year and children have even more, while 5 to 20 percent of the population gets the flu. Fortunately, there are steps you can take to minimize your risk and ease your symptoms.Consider these tips from Chloraseptic® pharmacist spokesperson Maria Mantione:• Get a flu shot. The CDC recommends a flu shot for everyone over the age of 6 months. It’s easy to get—just talk to your pharmacist. It’s the best way to prevent the spread of the flu. It does not prevent the common cold, but the flu is a devastating, serious illness that could put you out of commission for a week or more or, even worse, land you in the hospital with pneumonia or infect someone you love with a weaker immune system—such as babies, the elderly or those undergoing chemotherapy.• Wash your hands often. Washing your hands with soap and water is the best way to prevent the spread of the common cold.• Prevent illness by practicing healthy habits. Make sure to get enough sleep, eat a balanced, nutritious diet, exercise and minimize stress.• If you do get sick, talk to your pharmacist about how to manage your symptoms with medications. Before cold season, stock your medicine cabinet with the essentials. Stick to single-ingredient products, so you have what you need to treat your specific symptoms. These include pain relievers and fever reducers, a decongestant, cough medicine, lozenges and a sore throat spray. Topical medications, such as Chloraseptic sore throat sprays and lozenges, are great to have on hand because they’re portable, can be used safely with other cold medicines and have very few side effects.In fact, Chloraseptic is the No. 1 sore throat relief brand around. It provides fast-acting relief for sore throats and mouth pain to help you get through your day.From lozenges that soothe nasal passages and suppress coughs to sprays that target pain when and where it hurts, there’s a broad portfolio of products based on your preferences and needs.The lozenges have a soothing liquid center that relieves pain and cools nasal passages. MAX Wild Berry is the strongest throat relief lozenge in the line. Chloraseptic Total offers a multisymptom lozenge formula that can suppress your cough for up to four hours.Chloraseptic’s sprays are the No. 1 pharmacist-recommended brand. The new and improved Cherry Spray tastes great, works on contact and is free of aspirin, sugar and gluten. The MAX Wild Berry Targeted Throat Spray is convenient for travel or to keep in your purse. The targeted spray makes it easier when you’re on the go to coat and protect specific areas in your mouth and throat. All these products are available at mass retailers, major drugstores and grocery stores.Also helping to keep you ahead of the flu this season is an online Cold + Flu tracker. To check for outbreaks and symptoms, go to www.chloraseptic.com, click on Cold + Flu Tracker and enter your zip code.How To Combat Cold And Flu added by new_view_media on December 22, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Helping Older People to Maintain Independence(NAPSI)—For most older adults, the ability to live independently is associated with the ability to drive. That’s one reason the prospect of eventually “giving up the keys” can be a frightening one.To help, the experts on aging at the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging (n4a) developed a brochure called “Before You Give Up the Keys: Create a Roadmap for Transportation Independence” that may lessen those fears by empowering older adults to evaluate their mobility needs, identify the transportation options in their community and develop a plan customized to their unique circumstances.“A too-familiar scenario is that older adults wait until they’re involved in some sort of emergency, like a traffic accident, before they really think about their driving ability and the other transportation options available to them in their community,” said n4a CEO Sandy Markwood. “Our goal is to shed light on a critical issue that will likely affect most families with an older loved one who may need to limit or eliminate their driving, and to provide a catalyst for discussion, and hopefully, action,” Markwood also noted.The n4a represents America’s national network of 623 Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs). It helps older adults and people with disabilities live with dignity and choices in their homes and communities for as long as possible.To that end, it created the Eldercare Locator. This serves as an essential, trusted gateway to help older adults, caregivers and health professionals navigate the maze of aging programs and services, as well as to assist them in identifying and accessing the resources that match their needs best. The National Call Center operates five days a week from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET and can be reached at 800-677-1116 or www.eldercare.gov.According to recent research by the Federal Transit Administration, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, n4a and the National Aging and Disability Transportation Center, the rise in the 65-plus population—some 45 million and growing—has triggered a corresponding spike in the number of nondrivers of more than 1.1 million between 2001 and 2009.“This is a major issue for older adults because when they lack access to transportation, they can’t get to the doctor, the grocery store or see friends and family as much, which means their overall well-being is likely to suffer,” added Kathy Greenlee, Assistant Secretary for Aging.Free BrochureTo download the free brochure, go to www.n4a.org/files/ResourcesforOlderAdults.pdf.

      "Protect Your Health, Protect Your Toothbrush(NAPSI)—Did you know that keeping your toothbrush clean is a simple way to help protect your health and the health of your loved ones year-round, and especially during flu season?Dentists’ Advice for the Entire FamilyAccording to pediatric dentist Danielle Gilbert-Fowler, D.M.D., “Oral health is not just about your mouth, it’s about your overall health. The mouth is a major doorway for all sorts of microorganisms, which can be linked to anything from the common cold to heart disease and diabetes. Hence, the importance of having a healthy mouth cannot be overstated.”“More than 300 kinds of microorganisms thrive in the human mouth,” explains Astrid Shroetter, D.D.S. “What’s more, the typical toothbrush is reused for months and never cleaned thoroughly.”Research indicates that kids get sick on average about 10 times a year—that’s almost once a month. While dentists and parents both encourage good oral hygiene, it would be nice to do so without worrying about potential reinfection caused by brushing teeth with contaminated toothbrushes. As Dr. Gilbert-Fowler puts it, “You wouldn’t clean your house with a dirty washcloth. Why clean your teeth with a dirty toothbrush?”A Solution“It’s important to keep toothbrushes in a clean environment and separate from other toothbrushes,” recommends Gilbert-Fowler. “Use of a Steripod® clip-on toothbrush protector will help keep your toothbrush clean and protect against outside contaminants and cross contamination from other toothbrushes. It’s important for kids and adults alike to replace toothbrushes every three months or more frequently after any illness.”Developed by doctors and independently tested for efficacy at an accredited lab, Steripod is a clip-on protector that fits any standard or electric toothbrush. Using a patented natural vapor shield of thymol, derived from the thyme plant, Steripod keeps toothbrushes fresh and clean for up to three months. Simply clip it on your electric or manual toothbrush and it goes to work; no cables or batteries are needed. You can use it at home, work, the gym, school or when you travel.More Pearls of Wisdom for Your Pearly Whites:To further put the bite on dental disease, heed these five tips from the experts at the American Dental Association:1. Brush your teeth twice a day for two minutes with a soft-bristled brush.2. Replace your toothbrush every three or four months, or if the bristles are frayed.3. Use an ADA-accepted fluoride toothpaste.4. Clean between teeth daily with floss.5. Visit your dentist regularly for professional cleanings and oral exams.Learn MoreVisit www.GetSteripod.com or call (310) 204-7880.Protect Your Health, Protect Your Toothbrush added by new_view_media on December 22, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "6 Tips for Planning Your Wedding Photos Like a Pro\n",
      "Five words or less(NewsUSA) – With everything that goes into your wedding day, those once-in-a-lifetime moments will go by in a blur, which is why hiring a professional wedding photographer is a must. After all, the last thing you should be worrying about is whether your photographer will be able to capture your big day.\n",
      "The key? Prepare yourself so that you can accurately evaluate the “right” photographer for you.\n",
      "“The best photographer will take the time to build a rapport with you and use his or her experience and creativity to capture the mood, personality, ambiance and even the geography of your wedding,” says PPA (Professional Photographers of America) photographer Berit Bizjak. “The finest wedding photography is more than a series of still pictures. It’s physical poetry — it tells the story of the day and portrays the essence of both people and place.”\n",
      "To this end, PPA, the largest international nonprofit association created by professional photographers, has taken the guesswork out of the process by offering six tips to help you plan your wedding photos like a pro:\n",
      "1. Book far in advance. The best photographers get booked quickly — sometimes as much as a year in advance — so don’t wait until the last minute to book your photographer.\n",
      "2. Show them the money. Now is not the time to skimp on your photo budget. Call around and get a price range for services, and remember: after the cake is long gone, and the dress is stored away, your wedding photos will be the only things left to share and enjoy for years to come, so don’t cut too many corners on your photography budget — you’ll end up regretting it.\n",
      "3. Make sure your photographer is a real pro. Only hire someone who has liability insurance, experience taking the style of photos you want, backup equipment and a plan for when things go south. Ideally, he or she is a PPA photographer. PPA photographers do more than just snap pictures. They have the technical expertise and artistry to make you look your best and bring your vision to life. They also abide by a strict code of ethics that makes a real difference. Watch this (video) to see real married couples share their stories.\n",
      "4. Request to see a full gallery of real weddings. Look at full wedding coverage (not just a small selection of each wedding’s best moments) to see a photographer’s true style and get a sense of how he or she might tell your “story.” Do you prefer more artistic or traditional poses? Would you rather have a photojournalist approach or a mix of all styles?\n",
      "5.Work with your photographer to create a detailed shot list. PPA wedding photographers can also help you create that shot list, as they know what key moments tell a wedding story and can prepare for those. But talk about your must-haves, and walk through the entire program with your photographer ahead of time. Share your expectations ahead of time to ensure that he or she captures the key shots, while remaining attentive and available to catch the best candid moments.\n",
      "6. Plan your post-wedding photo strategy• ahead of time! Almost as soon as the festivities are over, you’ll be eager to look at the photos so you can relive your big day over and over again. Ask your photographer for teasers or a “sneak peek” and a timeline for when the rest of the pictures will be available. Will they give you an online gallery for family and friends to choose the images they want? Again, knowing these things ahead of time will make things easy on the back end, sparing you any heartache.6 Tips for Planning Your Wedding Photos Like a Pro added by new_view_media on December 22, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Wedding Gifts for Grooms: A Tradition Brides Shouldn’t Ignore\n",
      "Five words or less(NewsUSA) – The answer is: Yes, it’s expected.\n",
      "But it’s also a chance for all you brides out there to truly show you know that not everything is about you on your wedding day. That there really is another person involved (that would be the groom) who deserves a bit of recognition, too.\n",
      "We’re talking wedding presents — specifically, yours to your husband-to-be.\n",
      "Tradition does, indeed, hold that both you and he exchange gifts. And while it’s true that some guys are initially shocked to learn your engagement ring doesn’t also count as a “present,” that’s no excuse for you to waver.\n",
      "“Giving him something that’s just for him will make him feel really special,” advises BrideBox.com.\n",
      "Here’s what you need to know now that it’s prime time for weddings:\n",
      "* When to exchange them. Etiquette dictates that the hand-off occurs at one of three times: the night before the wedding, the morning of the ceremony, or right before leaving on your honeymoon. Think it’s bad luck to see the groom before the nuptials? “Many couples choose to courier gifts via bridesmaids or groomsmen just before the ceremony,” says Brides.com.\n",
      "* There’s a thin line between “romantic” and “mushy.” Some of you may be tempted to compile a “love notes” journal of every bit of correspondence you’ve ever sent your groom. Even assuming he’s the type who wouldn’t consider that a bit “over the top,” there’s always the chance he might be left wondering, “Okay, where’s my real present?”– especially if his gift to you is a serious piece of jewelry.\n",
      "* The consensus choice. There’s a reason a watch invariably makes everyone’s short list: It’s the perfect statement of who he is or aspires to be. (It’s also a lot more impressive than a flask, which for some reason also gets a few votes).\n",
      "No less a taste arbiter than MarthaStewartWeddings.com favors Baume & Mercier’s Clifton line — as elegant as the original 1950s model that inspired it — for the way it “easily transitions from big day to every day.” Like the Swiss watchmaker’s timelessly charming (and affordably luxurious) Classima line, it comes with a choice of straps, dial faces and a variety of what’s known as “small complications” that go way beyong just telling the hour. You can shop them at the Baume & Mercier e-boutique or by calling 1-800-MERCIER, where free engraving and wrapping are available.\n",
      "* Fun fact. One writer at AskMen.com says he’s “heard of women giving their husbands watches in the ceremony instead of a wedding ring.” If so, the answer is: No, just like your engagement ring, that wouldn’t also qualify as a wedding present.Wedding Gifts for Grooms: A Tradition Brides Shouldn’t Ignore added by new_view_media on December 22, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "WeddingDollarsCYou can thank Kim Kardashian and Kanye West for setting the bar so high when it comes to getting married.The average cost of a wedding — sans a honeymoon — has now soared to more than $31,000, according to the wedding planning website TheKnot. And experts say the “images of celebrity wedding extravagance,” a la last year’s $12 million “Kimye” nuptials in Florence, Italy, are influencing couples’ spending choices.Another reason for the jump, experts say, are the engagement rings.“People want big rings like the ones celebrities wear,” says Jason Kordvani, president of product development at Davani (davanijewelry.com), a family-owned company specializing in colored gemstones that has an almost 50-year reputation for creating some of the most gorgeous engagement rings around.Obviously, you don’t have to shell out that much to have the wedding of your dreams. But with this being the prime time for popping the question — 39 percent of all marriage proposals occur between Thanksgiving and Valentine’s Day — there is one trend that’s become both a must and a potential money-saving opportunity.Personalization, experts say, is on the rise.Here’s what we mean:• The engagement ring. If you’ve been reading the glossies, you know that celebs like Elizabeth Hurley and Jessica Simpson are breaking from tradition and wearing engagement rings with colored gemstones. Not only does this take fashion to a whole new level, but colored gemstones have also become a way to customize an engagement ring. And while it needn’t be her birthstone — Simpson’s is ruby, but Hurley’s sapphire jibes with the month her then-fiance was born — the right romantic touch can make for the ultimate in personalization.“It can also be the month a couple met or her favorite color,” says Kordvani.Whether sapphire, emerald, ruby or some other stone, Kordvani notes, couples are also often pleasantly surprised to discover they can get a “larger, more important-looking ring at much less cost than a diamond.” Davani Jewelry itself offers styles ranging from the more affordable Davani Bridal to the show-stopping Luxury Collection.• The reception. The bad news here is that spending on cocktail hours jumped 7 percent. So think signature cocktails rather than an open bar.• The wedding venue. “When couples get married, they’re really looking for interesting, unusual details,” Lorin Holmes, co-founder of VermontWeddings.com told USA Today. All things considered, the $50,000 price tag to hold a reception at the New York Public Library— anything cultural or historic is also hot — makes the average venue booking fee of $14,000 a little less jaw dropping.For more information, visit www.davanijewelry.com.The Many Colors of Love: Engagement Rings Get a Makeover added by new_view_media on December 22, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Want to Increase Revenue? Take Your Business Global(NAPSI)—International selling may seem daunting, but thanks to the Internet, it’s more attainable than ever. With the right tools in place, small businesses can go global and increase revenues without the headache.The question then is, “Where should I sell?” Consider these two destinations as you map out your plan for international growth:CanadaCanadians are e-commerce enthusiasts—in fact, 60 percent of Canada’s online shoppers buy from U.S.-based sellers. As an added bonus, there’s typically no language barrier for U.S. businesses selling into Canada.Given this opportunity for U.S. small businesses, the U.S. Postal Service opted to create zone-based pricing for all Priority Mail International® shipments headed to Canada starting on May 31, 2015.This means that the USPS will charge for shipping based on the U.S. origin ZIP code and the Canada destination postal code, instead of blending expensive routes into one flat rate.There will now be seven pricing zones for shipping. Some rates will increase, but for businesses in major cities—such as San Francisco, Miami and Chicago—savings will be around $8 per package.BrazilLatin America is the world’s second-fastest-growing e-commerce market, and leading this boom is Brazil. With 202 million citizens, of whom 33.5 million shop online, Brazil presents a huge opportunity for U.S.-based businesses looking to expand, though it’s not without its challenges.Due to delays in customs clearance, postal packages could take up to 20 days to arrive. Duties and taxes, as well as complicated custom forms, slow the process for both U.S. merchants and the buyers.However, there are solutions. Shipping technology company Endicia just launched a program called Endicia Global Service, which allows shipments from U.S. businesses to reach Brazilian customers in as little as 8 days. Additionally, duties and taxes can be paid by the buyer up front, and there are no complicated customs forms to fill out.“International selling is a great way to grow a business and secure additional revenue,” said Endicia co-founder and general manager Amine Khechfé. “These markets in particular are undergoing massive growth, and there’s never been a better time for small businesses to look into them.”To learn about the tools you need to succeed in going global, check out www.endicia.com/go-global.Want to Increase Revenue?

      "(BPT) – Remember free time? You used to have so much of it. But these days, work and family obligations have you running around constantly and you don’t know what to do first. You don’t even have time to do everything you have to do, let alone what you want to do.So how do you take back your day? How do you find the time to get things done and bring back some semblance of order? It is possible if you focus on making yourself more efficient. To help you accomplish all of your goals and find some free time as well, here are four ways you can improve your efficiency every single day.* Make a plan. When you’re running through your list of daily obligations the morning of, it’s easy to forget a thing or two, especially if you have children running around, phones ringing or dogs barking to distract you. Instead, plan out the upcoming day the night before. Make a list of everything you have to do and check these items against one another. Can two trips be combined? Are you prioritizing the most important things first? The better you can plan out your schedule, the more organized you’ll be the next day.* Get the news and information you need ASAP. You are bombarded by digital content every day and some of it is really important – but who has time to sift through it all? To help you find the information you need as quickly as possible, Fresly LLC launched a new app, iNews Photo. Whether you are on the go, or gathering news in your office this application allows you access to global and local news curated in real time by former journalist directly to your mobile phone or on a larger screen.* Set priorities. You don’t have time to do it all and maybe you don’t have to. Sit down and make a list of every social or professional group and obligation you belong to. Once you’ve made the list, look at it and ask yourself honestly how important this obligation is to you or your family. If you find the obligation is not essential, you’re better off to abandon it and save your time for the responsibilities that are more important to you.* Limit multitasking. Many people look to multitasking as an efficiency solution, but doing several things at once means it takes longer to accomplish any one task. And when the first task is completed, the result is often poorer because of it. Instead of trying to do several things at once, focus on the most important thing, accomplish it and move on.With today’s hectic schedules, finding the opportunity to do everything you’re supposed to do may seem impossible. However, if you apply the four tips listed above, you’ll improve your efficiency, stay up on the latest news and maybe even discover that elusive free time you sorely deserve.

      "medical workers working together in hospital(BPT) – Over the last decade, a number of changes have transformed the healthcare industry. The Affordable Care Act has enabled more than 16.4 million Americans to receive healthcare coverage. Advancements in technology improve both diagnoses and treatment quality. Retail health offers a convenience used by more than 10 million patients at 1,800 retail health locations. Along with the current challenges facing the healthcare system, such as an aging population, increased patient volume and physician shortages, these changes prompt the expansion of the traditional role of a nurse.Generally, Americans believe nurses’ roles are expanding as they share increased responsibilities to support the delivery of high quality healthcare, according to a poll commissioned by University of Phoenix College of Health Professions. The survey also found that adults in the United States view their experience with nurses as overwhelmingly positive. In fact, 95 percent found nurses to be a valuable addition to the healthcare system as a whole, and 87 percent view nurses as trusted sources of health information.“As nurses take on greater responsibility, and as the needs of healthcare organizations continue to grow more complex, the skills and training requirements of nurses must be prepared to match this growth,” says Betty Nelson, Ph.D., RN, and academic dean for University of Phoenix School of Nursing. “This is especially important given that the United States is currently facing a shortage of as many as 90,000 physicians by 2025.. Nurses with advanced education can help fill this shortage, particularly in areas where consumers do not have access to care.”Because of this, employers are looking for nurses with a variety of skills and certifications including:* Additional degrees or seeking an advanced degree* In-demand skills such as bilingualism, leadership and critical thinking* Flexibility and professionalism* The desire to grow into advanced practitioners such as nurse practitioners and physician assistants* Specialized training for working with various populations* An openness to diverse opportunities in a number of different facilitiesIn order to keep up with the changes in the healthcare system, at least 80 percent of the nation’s nursing workforce will need a bachelor’s degree by 2020 and the number of nurses with doctoral degrees will need to be double, according to the Institute of Medicine. Nursing education institutions play a critical role in meeting the needs of today’s healthcare system. Nurses need a place to obtain these degrees and further their skills within the healthcare industry. Institutions recognize the expanding role of the 21st century nurse and are offering a wide range of curriculum and degree programs that address recent changes in the delivery of primary care. Graduates need to be equipped with the skills they need to succeed in today’s health care market.It’s now more important than ever that nurses have the training and skills to match the demands of the growing profession. Along with the nursing community, institutions that offer nursing degree programs must work together to enhance and better prepare the nursing workforce.What employers look for in the 21st century nurse added by new_view_media on November 15, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "(BPT) – What image does the word “grilling” bring to mind? Do you envision thick, juicy burgers or steaks? What about sauce-slathered chicken breasts sizzling over coals? Cooking out is one of the great joys of warm weather, but if you leave side dishes out of your grilling plans – or stick with cold sides like salads – you’re missing out on some great flavors.Side dishes give you a chance to really show off your grilling chops, savor the farm fresh flavors of summer harvests, and indulge in wholesome, organic fare. Here are six summer side dishes that go great on the grill:1. Corn on the cob – If you’ve always wanted to try grilling vegetables but weren’t sure which of your favorites would go well on the grill – take heart! Virtually any veggie can be prepared on a grill, but corn becomes a show-stopper when grilled. Remove the husks and silk and toss the cobs right on a preheated grill. Watch them careful and keep turning them to ensure they brown but don’t burn. The heat from the grill causes the natural sugars in the corn to carmelize, and you’ll end up with the sweetest sweet corn you ever tasted!2. Fries – A trip to the grocery store or farmer’s market for fresh produce may not fit in your schedule if you’re grilling on the fly. There’s good news – frozen options like Alexia Organic Oven Crinkles with Sea Saltdeliver farm to flavor taste when prepared on the grill or in the oven. Made from Pacific Northwest russet potatoes, Alexia’s organic fries are sprinkled with bright sea salt to bring out even more of the rich flavor that Mother Nature delivered. Make a tray out of aluminum foil, spread the Oven Crinkles in a single layer, and grill for about 20-25 minutes at 400-450 degrees F. Turn once or twice during the cooking process.3. Tomatoes – If you’ve only grilled small tomatoes on a kabob, or never tried grilled tomatoes at all, this is your summer to discover grilling tomatoes couldn’t be easier. Start with large, meaty tomatoes – a variety that’s dense and has fewer seeds works best. Slice in half, brush with your favorite seasoned oil and place the halves cut-side down on the grill. Cook for 3-5 minutes on each side. Top with your favorite cheese when done.4. Kale – Grilling greens like kale helps all those wonderful nutrients and flavor stay in the vegetable and don’t disappear into the cooking water – which is what can happen when you boil veggies on the stovetop. Grilling kale couldn’t be easier. You can adapt virtually any of your favorite kale recipes to grilling by tossing the kale with the recipe seasonings and some oil. Arrange the seasoned leaves in a single layer on the grill and they’ll cook to crispy splendor in just minutes.5. Cheese – A slice of gooey melted cheese is the crowning glory atop your grilled burger, but cheese can also handle the grill on its own, and be a delicious, different side dish or appetizer. Many cheeses will work on the grill, and you can find recommendations for the best cheeses to cook on the grill with a simple online search. Slice your chosen cheese in thick pieces. Most grilling cheeses will need minimal seasoning and little or no oil. Generally, cheese takes just a minute or two to brown each side and allow the inside to melt.6. Dinner rolls – Craving dinner rolls to go with that thick juicy steak, but in no mood to fire up the oven when it’s 90 degrees outside? You can make frozen dinner rolls on the grill. Choose your favorite variety, such as Alexia Artisan French Rolls or Artisan Focaccia Rolls, set your gas grill to the temperature recommended on the package’s directions, wrap the rolls in foil and place directly on the grill. Keep an eye on the rolls to ensure they don’t burn as they can cook quickly on a grill.6 summer sides you never knew you could grill added by new_view_media on April 3, 2016View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "(BPT) – Traditional wedding rules have fallen by the wayside – food trucks are in, having a hashtag is a must, bridesmaids no longer wear the same dress and groomsmen are sometimes in sneakers. Couples are actively seeking ways to differentiate themselves and get creative. All that aside, there is one thing that remains constant – weddings must have wine.Without wine, there is no glass to raise during the toast to the bride and groom and nothing to drink when the bar closes during dinner. Wine is the first thing guests are offered when they take a seat, and – you know that they say – it’s important to make a good first impression.Choosing the right varietals for your wedding does not have to be a stressful endeavor. Whether you’re a novice wine drinker or a connoisseur, follow these four tips and you’ll please a crowd without spending a fortune:Say “cheers!” with a sparkling wine.People love a good toast, and nothing washes down a teary maid of honor speech like a glass of sparkling. Riondo Prosecco is an accessible option that’s ideal to enjoy any day of the year, but perfectly suited for special occasions. You’ll get six pours out of a bottle, so plan accordingly!Good things come in threes.In addition to a sparkling, you’ll want a red and a white option that are familiar and food-friendly. You can’t go wrong with a Merlot – look for labels from the Napa region. For a white, Terlato Friuli Pinot Grigio is exceptional and ideal for food pairing.Wine math: What you didn’t learn in school.Running out of wine mid-wedding isn’t an option, so it’s important to do the math. You should anticipate getting about 5 glasses per bottle and assume that each guest will drink one glass per hour. Follow this rule and the wine will flow all night long, keeping you and your guests happy.Don’t break the bank, but stay away from the cheap stuff.Choosing an excellent wine doesn’t mean paying top-dollar, but buying too cheap can mean sacrificing quality. There are countless high-quality, delicious, wines available for $10-$20 per bottle, so leave the cheap stuff on the bottom shelf!4 wine buying tips for weddings added by new_view_media on April 3, 2016View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "(BPT) – Around-the-clock food shows, celebrity guests and niche themed restaurants are just a few reasons the fine food movement continues to experience extraordinary growth. In 2016, more people will be seeking upscale dining experiences that focus on the unique to the luxurious — and they’re willing to pay big bucks to do so.In fact, Americans said they would splurge an average of $203 in order to have a once-in-a-lifetime dining experience at a gourmet restaurant, according to a recent online survey by Harris Poll sponsored byMichelin, the global tire maker that publishes the popular restaurant guide.What’s surprising is the people willing to pay the most for fine dining experiences are younger generations. Millennials (ages 18-34) on average would pay $282 for this culinary experience, compared to diners ages 45-54 who would shell out $170, and $122 for those 65 and older.One explanation for why younger diners are willing to pay so much is that they want to enjoy more than just fine cuisine. Many restaurants offer an overall experience that will be remembered long after the last morsel of food is gone. Whether it’s an incredible atmosphere, the opportunity to observe the chef work or gaining access to foods and cooking styles never available before, this desire for an experience is driving younger diners to invest in upscale dining.As America looks at the most recent Michelin star ratings to navigate the nation’s best eateries, there are some food and restaurant trends that are positioned to grow in 2016. Chefs will continue to expand their creative prowess by experimenting with new cooking styles and food fusions. Cooking methods will blend with science and art to create uniquely fine fare with a story that is as intriguing as the taste.Diversity is another notable trend for 2016. Authentic ethnic cuisine is in high demand and restaurants are answering the call. Traditional restaurants will begin to offer diverse plates in addition to timeless favorites to appeal to a wide range of palates. Expect to see more ancient grains, ethnic spices and worldly condiments at eateries in the future.Conscious dining is a growing trend thanks to diners’ increasing awareness of where their food comes from. Hyper-local sourcing of ingredients is being adopted by many notable restaurants. This includes growing fresh herbs and vegetables onsite and partnering with local farms for incredibly fresh dairy and meat products. Sustainable seafood partnerships are another effort by restaurants that supports the increasing demand for responsible dining options.Finally, diners are seeking chefs with the best reputation for tried-and-true favorites. That means the city’s chef with a reputation for curating and cooking the best steak will have a wait list. Supporting this nod toward the traditional, the Michelin survey found a quarter of U.S. adults say steakhouse cuisine is their favorite choice for dining. What’s the runner up? Italian ranked as the second choice nationally for the meal of a lifetime.Which 2016 dining trend do you want to try most? added by new_view_media on April 3, 2016View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "(BPT) – Snacks, produce, drinks or sweets – if it is a seasonal offering, Americans are anxiously awaiting it. According to Nielsen, Americans spend about $374 billion annually on snack foods. For many of those snack lovers, items that are only available for a limited time are one of the major highlights of seasonal occasions and holidays, especially this time of year when, according to a recent Cheetos brand survey, 65 percent of Americans profess their love of seasonal Easter treats.Whether your favorite holiday arrives in spring, summer, winter or fall, seasonal treats can sweeten your enjoyment of the season. No one wants to miss the coveted special flavors and offerings that appear on store shelves for short stints and are quickly cleared out by that clever “seasonal snack stockpiler” who is always one step ahead of you. So here’s your guide to the top treats to watch for this spring, and throughout the year.SpringIt might still be too chilly to feel like spring in some areas of the country, but St. Patrick’s Day undoubtedly marks the start of the springtime snacking season. Milkshake lovers will kick things off with mint-green milkshakes, and quickly turn their attention to Easter candies and snacks.Chocolate and marshmallow sweets are the traditional stars of Easter baskets across the country – for both the young, and the young at heart. It is no surprise that 71 percent of parents who celebrate Easter admit to sneaking snacks from their kids’ baskets, according to the Cheetos survey.Of course, everyone is familiar with jelly beans, peanut butter eggs, chocolate bunnies and marshmallow chicks, but the majority of consumers say they desire more variety beyond just candy. This year, there’s a new must-try alternative to satisfy the search for something beyond the candy animal monotony. Cheetos Sweetos, the cinnamon-sugar version of everyone’s favorite cheddar cheese snacks is reappearing in stores — and Easter baskets — this spring, but only for a limited time. Launched in 2015, Sweetos snacks are the perfect, and delicious, twist on Easter snacking.SummerFrozen treats are the highlight of summer, but not just the ice cream quarts you find year-round in the freezer cases at your local grocer. Summer means the ice cream truck will be rolling through neighborhood streets, sounding that familiar melodic “come and get it” tune and serving up frozen favorites that you just can’t find anywhere else —  or at any other time of year.You can’t go wrong with the missile-shaped, multi-colored ice pops that beckon from beside a myriad of fruit-flavored cream pops, or reliable favorites like ice cream sandwiches and chocolate-topped cones. And don’t forget snow cones — the refreshing shaved ice in perfect spheres mounted on a paper funnel and topped with your favorite sweet flavoring!FallOf course everyone knows fall is pumpkin season — and you should take every chance to enjoy all things pumpkin-flavored this time of year, from coffee and ice cream to bread, cake and pie.However, autumn also heralds state fair season across the country — and the arrival of a variety of innovative sweet treats that can only be enjoyed among the unique surroundings of fair rides, tickets and games. Funnel cakes are a state fair staple, and what could be better when the weather gets nippy than enjoying lightly sweetened, deep-fried dough dusted heavily with confectioner’s sugar? Depending on where you live in the country and which fair you attend, you can find over-the-top sweets and snacks such as deep-fried ice cream, fried candy bars and even pretzel-encrusted brownies deep-fried on a stick.WinterOf course, winter holidays are the pinnacle of seasonal snacking. From the final weeks of pumpkin season to the eggnog, candy canes and baked goods associated with holiday moments from Thanksgiving through New Year’s, winter serves up a buffet of food and snacks that are available at no other time of year.Winter’s arrival means anticipated delicacies like gingerbread-flavored everything, bite-sized candy favorites that marry mint and chocolate in holiday shapes, and of course the much-maligned and equally beloved fruit cake all hit store shelves just in time to make the holiday party circuit!Whatever your preference — savory, salty or sweet — make sure to enjoy these snacking staples throughout the year. But remember that seasonal treats come and go quickly, so be ready to grab a bag of Sweetos snacks, remember to listen for the ice cream truck’s playful tune, try your state’s delicacies and fill stockings with enough gingerbread cookies or mint-themed chocolate drops to last through the end of the year!Don’t miss these must-have snacks that define each season of the year added by new_view_media on April 3, 2016View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Be Well Tressed Every Day With Wigs(NAPSI)—Changing your hair to suit your hat, your mood or your outfit-or to make holidays and other celebrations that much more special—can be easier and more fun than ever.TV Star’s IdeaExplains Daytime Emmy Award winner Sherri Shepherd, “When I was a little girl, I would hear all this commotion in my house from my mom, aunts and grandmother when picking out their wigs for the day. It was such a good time for them and was a major part of their everyday beauty routines. Ever since then, I’ve watched the women in my household glow with confidence because they would customize their look day by day through the use of faux hair. My grandmother had a wig that she would pick out and wear perfectly with specific hats. My mother had an Angela Davis ‘power to the people’ wig. Watching these iconic women in my life pair their hair lengths, styles and colors with particular hats, outfits and personalities was exciting. Getting ready to go out was like an event in and of itself. Wigs are the perfect way for the inner diva in all women to come out and get creative, which is why I was inspired to start my own wig line to give women the choices to create their own style and look.“I always say, you were born with the hair you’ve got—now get the hair you want. Short and sassy, long and sexy or curly and fierce; you can easily change your hairstyle and transform your whole look to fit whatever your day brings. This is one of the reasons I wanted to create my line of wigs for Luxhair—I wanted to be able to give busy women high-quality, versatile looks to choose from that were simple and quick to put on but that were affordable and wouldn’t break their budget too.”The result is the Luxhair Now by Sherri Shepherd high-fashion wig and extension collection. “The collection provides the look you want, the style you want and the perfect accent to make a personal style statement, now.”Why WigsLike putting on your most stylish shoes and more powerful than a red lipstick, Shepherd says, these high-fashion styles can add some fabulous to your everyday. They can also be an excellent accessory to have during the holiday season when you want a party perfect ‘do but don’t want to spend a lot of time getting it. With a variety of lace front styles that give the appearance of natural hair growth, allow for styling away from the face and heat-friendly fiber, these wigs stand up to heat and humidity, offer styling options, and look, feel and move like real hair.What’s NewNow that Luxhair Now by Sherri Shepherd has partnered with national retailer Sally Beauty Supply, two new fun wig styles are available in over 1,900 stores nationwide.• Textured Pixie is a sassy pixie wig that features choppy texture for maximum volume and style along with precision-cut bangs that frame the face. It comes in medium dark brown, medium and light auburn and golden brown with auburn highlights.• The Feathered Pixie is a short, side-swept pixie with feathered texture and volume. It comes in medium dark brown and golden brown with auburn highlights.Each is made with revolutionary Luxhair Keralon heat-friendly synthetic fiber that looks and feels like real hair and can be heat styled up to 320° F.Learn MoreFor further facts, including where to find these wigs, go to www.sallybeauty.com and www.luxhair.com.Be Well Tressed Every Day With Wigs added by new_view_media on December 22, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "On National Senior Citizens Day, Three Ways To Celebrate The Older Generation(NAPSI)—Whether it’s your parents, grandparents, aunt, uncle or neighbor, you likely received guidance from or looked to older people in your life as you’ve tried to become more independent and deal with change and everyday challenges. August 21 is National Senior Citizens Day, and it’s an ideal time to honor seniors for the wisdom and care they have provided us, and also to celebrate the members of the older generation by finding ways to enhance their lives as they age.There’s No Place Like HomeNearly 90 percent of seniors want to age in place—stay in their own homes as they get older. But one out of three seniors suffers a fall each year, according to the CDC. Making an older person’s home as safe as possible is integral to helping him or her maintain this independence. Walking through seniors’ daily routine with them, from the time they get out of bed to when they go back to sleep, can reveal patterns in how they navigate their home and any potential hazards. By identifying the areas of concern and making necessary adjustments, you can decrease the risk of an accident and seniors can reside more confidently in their own home.Stay ConnectedTechnology now allows grandparents to FaceTime their children and grandchildren across the globe or even in the next town, and seniors to reconnect with classmates of decades past via Facebook. Older generations can create, build and maintain quality social relationships with the convenience and ease of social media. Seniors have a multitude of online outlets to share updates, photos and videos with loved ones. To help them stay in touch, ensure that the seniors in your life have reliable Internet connectivity, and help them set up social media accounts if they don’t have one already. In-person interaction is ideal, but keeping in touch through computers, tablets and smartphones is a great way to supplement seeing and speaking with each other.Everyone’s Wearing TechnologyWearable technology like the Apple Watch is popular among younger audiences, but wearable fitness trackers and medical alert devices can provide great benefits to seniors as well. In the event of a fall or accident where it’s impossible to get to a phone to call for help, a medical alert device immediately connects the injured to emergency services. Because that person’s medical history and health needs are on file, first responders can more easily treat them. With help a push of a button away, medical alert devices give seniors peace of mind even beyond health concerns. In fact, a recent survey by Bay Alarm Medical found that 80 percent of medical alert device wearers worry less when their adult children travel because they feel the device provides an adequate support system. If you decide to help protect the senior in your life with a wearable medical alert system, it’s also wise to look for a caring, people-first, ethical provider. Bay Alarm Medical, for example, implemented a Code of Ethics it follows for uncompromisingly ethical and transparent business practices. The company vows to prioritize customers over sales, make pricing publicly accessible and never pressure customers into a product or service they do not need, among other safeguards.National Senior Citizens Day is a day to commemorate the great ways in which seniors have helped us and we should show them how thankful we are every day. Simple steps such as a home safety walk-through, staying connected and providing the tools to enhance their physical and emotional well-being can go a long way in reducing the stress of aging for seniors and their loved ones.On National Senior Citizens Day, Three Ways To Celebrate The Older Generation added by new_view_media on December 24, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Don’t Let The Flu Mean Missing Memorable Moments(NAPSI)—While the cold and flu season often coincides with holiday celebrations and family get-togethers, there are preventative measures that families can take to stay healthy and not miss out.To help you get to the next “can’t miss” life event, consider these top preventative tips:• Get an annual flu shot. It’s the most effective way to help prevent the spread of influenza. For your convenience, you can get a vaccine at any of the more than 7,800 CVS/pharmacy and 900 MinuteClinic locations across the country. The flu shot is available every day with no appointment needed, including evenings and weekends.As a preventive service under the Affordable Care Act, it’s fully covered and available at no cost through most insurance plans, including Medicare Part B.The pharmacy can also be a one-stop shop for flu prevention resources, including over-the-counter cold and flu remedies, multivitamins and anti-bacterial cleaning products. Plus, anyone enrolled in the ExtraCare Rewards program gets a 20 percent off CVS Shopping Pass upon getting the flu shot in most places.• Seniors, take extra precaution. There’s a high-dose flu shot designed for those 65 and older, who have a greater risk of severe illness from the flu.• Plan ahead: the earlier, the better. It takes up to two weeks for your immunity to build up after getting a flu shot. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone who is at least 6 months old get a flu shot as soon as the vaccine is available.• Stay home if you’re ill. While it may seem like a no-brainer, two-thirds of employed Americans would still go to work even if they were feeling ill with flu-like symptoms. It’s important to understand the preliminary symptoms of the flu and, if you experience them, to stay home. This will help bolster your immune system and prevent the germs spreading.• Practice healthy habits. Door handles, desks and other everyday items are ridden with germs. Wash your hands frequently with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds and avoid touching your mouth and eyes. Additionally, eat nutritious foods, drink plenty of water, and get sufficient sleep to keep your immune system in top shape. Lead by example to educate children about these habits.Learn MoreFor further information and to find a nearby store, visit www.cvs.com/flu or download the CVS/pharmacy mobile app.Don’t Let The Flu Mean Missing Memorable Moments added by new_view_media on December 24, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Medicare Open Enrollment: What You Need To Knowby Patricia Smith(NAPSI)—Every year, millions of Medicare beneficiaries must decide which Medicare Advantage (MA) plan will best serve their needs. During Medicare’s annual open enrollment period, October 15-December 7, you can change MA plans or enroll in one for the first time. Important factors to consider include premium costs, choice of doctors and plan benefits. But there is one other important question: What is the quality rating of the plan?Quality is important because it means better health care and the best value for your money. Medicare uses a system called Star Ratings to assess the quality of plans, awarding plans from one to five stars. These ratings are based on many factors, such as how well the plan does in keeping people healthy and preventing illness, how quickly you can get an appointment and see specialists, and how the plan responds to your complaints and concerns.Today, 65 percent of MA enrollees are in plans with four stars or more, compared to 17 percent in 2009. Eight of the 12 MA plans earning five stars this year are members of the Alliance of Community Health Plans, an organization representing high-quality health plans.You can learn more about MA plans using the Medicare Plan Finder at www.Medicare.gov. The National Committee for Quality Assurance also evaluates quality in MA plans at www.ncqa.org.• Ms. Smith is the president and CEO of the Alliance of Community Health Plans, www.achp.org.Medicare Open Enrollment: What You Need To Know added by new_view_media on December 24, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Triple Sorghum Granola(Family Features) As you look to the new year with plans for healthier habits, there’s no better place to start than the beginning – the beginning of each day, that is. Countless studies have shown the benefits of a nutritious breakfast as part of a healthy eating plan, and there are plenty of options to make a good-for-you breakfast that tastes great, too.Experts agree that there are numerous health benefits to breakfast. For example, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics credits breakfast with helping brain function and memory as well as preventing tiredness and overeating as the day wears on. Mayo Clinic staff adds that adults who eat breakfast are likely to consume more vitamins and minerals, and less fats and cholesterol.Wake up your morning routine with these tips for a healthier start to each day:Plan a well-rounded meal. Incorporate whole grains, like sorghum, lean protein, low-fat dairy and fruits and vegetables, for a nutrient-rich meal that will keep you fueled and feeling full until lunch time.Experiment with new flavors. Avoid burnout and boredom by trying new foods. For example, substitute your typical grain with sorghum, an American-grown cereal grain. In addition to its delicious flavor, sorghum is a highly versatile ingredient that is naturally high in fiber, iron and protein and can be used in a wide range of preparations.Eliminate obstacles. If hectic mornings are preventing you from getting a healthy breakfast, find solutions that work for you and your family. Prepare make-ahead foods that you can heat in minutes or look for options that are easy to eat on the go, such as this Triple Sorghum Granola, which can be made ahead and stored in an airtight container to maintain its crunchy texture.Find more ideas for incorporating sorghum into your healthy new year at Facebook.com/TasteSorghum.

      "Many in the Morristown community and beyond knew Myles Mislavsky (Morristown High School – Class of 2013). His smile was contagious and his friendliness was well-known. To honor his life, his family – Hector Mislavsky, Judy Martinez and Jessie Mislavsky – has created a college-debt forgiveness fund – the Myles Smiled on You Award – for Morristown High School alumni to be administered by the Morris Educational Foundation. The award, for secondary education loan reduction, will be given to deserving MHS alumni who exemplify Myles’ many positive characteristics. It was created to reduce the burden of debt many students carry after college making it hard for them to save and get ahead. The award is funded by family, friends and the Golden Bagel Runners who knew and loved Myles. Myles was an amazing human being. Witty, charismatic, giving and loyal…these words merely scratch the surface in describing Myles. He made a lasting impact on the lives of those around him and was committed to helping others. He radiated joy with a smile so infectious that even on your worst days, he lifted your spirit. People were drawn to Myles and were better having known him. The award application is open to all Morristown High School alumni – Class of 2009 and after – who have graduated from a college, university or trade school (2 or 4 year) and have student loans. In 2019, this scholarship will be awarded to multiple alumni who graduated after 2009, at least one of whom graduated with Myles in 2013. In addition to demonstrating college debt burden, the award application requires 3 – 250 word or less essays: how have you dealt with challenging situations (mental or physical health, or other) and how did you or are you dealing with those challenges; describe how you have demonstrated empathy toward others; and what do you do to help your family/community, as well as a letter of recommendation. “We are honored to administer the Myles Smiled On You Award on behalf of the Mislavsky/Martinez family. We are so grateful to our donors, like the Mislavskys/Martinez Family, whose generosity inspires and impacts our Morristown High School community,” said Patty Haralampoudis, the Chair of the Morris Educational Foundation. It is the hope of the Mislavsky/Martinez Family that with this financial award, Myles will “smile on” Morristown High School alumni just as he did during his amazing life. Morris Educational Foundation Announces Myles Smiled on You Award for College-Debt Forgiveness Created in honor of Myles Mislavsky  added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "By Dawn M Chiossi  Morristown High School Graduate Amelia Langan has certainly been busy. Thanks to her recent activities in raising awareness about organ and tissue donation, she founded a Donate Life club at her school and was one of six students awarded a scholarship for the 2019-2020 academic year from the New Jersey Sharing Network.   The New Jersey Sharing Network is committed to saving and enhancing lives through organ donation. Giving a second chance at life, organ and tissue donation does just that. Just making that one decision can save lives, and make a huge, enriching impact on the lives of others.   As Langan discovered, it can also do the same thing for the self.   Like most people, Langan became aware of the importance of organ donation only when she took her driver’s education class in school. In hearing speaker– and liver transplant recipient–Michele Dabal, she became aware of how organ donation can impact and benefit others.  “She cleared up a lot of misconceptions and concerns that people have regarding organ donation,” Langan explains. “Hearing her story on how organ donation helped her to survive really resonated with me,” Langan shares.  Langan was so inspired by Dabal, she began to do her own research regarding organ donation, about how many lives could be changed for the better. It soon became a cause she became passionate about.   “One person can save up to eight lives with organ donation, and up to fifty with tissue donation,” she enthuses.  Langan was awarded the scholarship for diligently volunteering with the New Jersey Sharing Network, devoting an impressive 80 hours to volunteering.  Additionally, she raised awareness regarding organ and tissue donation for her Girl Scout Gold Award project.    Wanting to inspire others regarding organ donation, Langan founded a Donate Life club at her high school. The club came into existence during her junior year of 2017.    Describing Morristown’s Donate Life club as a small one of approximately 20-25 members, they do so much. Members volunteer with the New Jersey Sharing Network. Additionally, the club lined up speakers for people to hear inspiring stories regarding their organ and tissue donations.  For Langan, the goal was to get people talking about organ donation and to start a conversation about it. The club did this in a variety of ways.   “This is such an easy way to make a positive impact in our country. Organ donation affects everyone everywhere (even globally). It is so widespread,” she asserts. Through her passion and research, Langan and the club discovered that in Morristown alone, approximately 21 people were on the list looking for a transplant. “Everyone knows someone affected.”  Although Langan is a Freshman at Boston’s Northeastern University and is already fully committed to majoring in behavioral neuroscience and minoring in biochemistry to go into the field of research for cancer, she still is helping in the cause close to her heart. She has extended the parameters of the club, creating a video explaining and inspiring other high school students how they can help in the cause of organ donation and create a Donate Life club of their own.  Langan’s excitement to inspire others to make a difference through organ and tissue donation has even extended to her sister and her sister’s best friend. Both are going to take up the mantle of Morristown’s Donate Life club, to put their own ideas to it.   For Langan, everything is connected and stems from the information and inspiration she received from Driver’s Ed class. “I was so surprised to receive the scholarship,” she shares. “I didn’t think I had a chance of winning. It was Michele who persuaded me to apply. If I hadn’t met her, I wouldn’t have been inspired to do any of this. It wasn’t just me, (being awarded the scholarship or success of the club) so many people were a beacon of encouragement. From Michele, to Brooke, and Daniel Sarnowski at New Jersey Sharing Network, to so many others behind the scenes. I’m very grateful.”Changing the World, Raising Awareness About Organ and Tissue Donation, Morristown Grad Founds Donate Life Club, Wins Scholarship added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "By: Jason Cohen Swimming runs in the blood of Jack Alexy. All of his siblings are swimmers, but he will be the first to have the chance to be in the Olympics. In June 2020, the Mendham resident will be competing against 1500 people in the Olympic Trials for swimming in Omaha, Neb. “I’m not going to know how it feels until I’m there,” Alexy said. “I know I’m definitely going to be nervous.” Alexy, 16, is a junior at Delbarton School in Morristown and has been swimming for the Somerset Hills YMCA Swim team in Basking Ridge since he was 8. After watching his older siblings Kate, 20, and Max, 18, swim; he quickly fell in love with the sport and followed in their footsteps. While his parents Lynn and Matt were not swimmers, they felt it was important for their children to learn. Their younger brother, Rob, 15, also swims.“My parents just wanted all of their kids to know how to swim for safety,” Alexy explained. Alexy said Kate and Max had a big influence on him. Swimming brought them closer and they taught him to never give up and always stay calm. In fact, Kate swims at Kenyon College in Ohio and Alexy hopes to swim in college as well. Alexy also played basketball, but quit in eighth grade to focus on swimming.He started to realize he had a future in swimming three years ago when he made the YMCA Nationals team. After that, he made nationals the next three years.Today swimming is a huge part of his life. He practices six days a week for two hours a day and has a few dry practices as well. In fact, he met some of his best friends from swimming.“That’s one of the best things about swimming, the people and the bonds,” he commented. In 2016 Lori Riegler took over as his coach. Over the past few years they have gotten close and she has helped him become a better swimmer. Alexy knows he has a long road ahead as he prepares for the Olympic Trials. He qualified for the 50 and 100 meter freestyle and in order to make the Olympics has to finish top two in an event. Right now he trains by swimming 25 yards, but in the trials it is 50 meters. So, in February, he will change his to 50. “It’s pretty crazy,” he said. “I still got a lot of work to do before then.”In August, he had a bit of a preview of what it will be like at the trials when he participated in the World Junior Championships in Budapest, Hungary. It was his first intentional competition. “It’s (Olympic Trials) definitely special,’ he said. “I got a little taste of that over the summer in Budapest.” Mendham Resident to Compete in Olympic Trials for Swimming  added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "By: Elise Phillips Margulis  Mendham-based artist Jeff Gould, known for his stunning fine art landscapes and abstract Surrealistic compositions, is having an  exhibition called “Views from Schiff” which will feature paintings directly from and inspired by Schiff Nature Preserve in Mendham.  Gould will be showing his “nature and animal surreal mashups” as well. The exhibit will also include Japanese-inspired artwork by artist Al Gunther www.dragonflystudios-algunther.com.” The “Views from Schiff” exhibit will be on October 5th from 4:00 to 6:00 p.m. at the Alhamra Gallery and Art Center in Bernardsville. Blues legend Barry Blues will play a music set and refreshments will be served. The entertainment and food are free. Some of the proceeds will go to Schiff Nature Preserve. Gould hails from New Rochelle, NY. He recalls being “artistic at a very early age and copying cartoons out of the newspaper, including Charlie Brown for a piece of promotional material for my kindergarten class.” He drew “Mad Magazine” characters when he was a bit older. Gould also enjoyed drawing superheroes. Some of his favorite artists and inspirations are Mort Drucker and Don Martin. Gould’s biggest childhood artist influence was Norman Rockwell. “I used to sit down for hours with pencil and paper trying to copy his paintings,” shared Gould.  “Oddly, we seem to occupy the same towns. From growing up in New Rochelle where he lived, to spending summers in the Berkshires where his main studio was.” Gould added, “And now I live in the Schiff on Rockwell Court which was named after him because he had a studio here and painted some of the early covers of the Boy Scout manuals!” After Gould graduated from University of the Arts in Philadelphia, he designed toys for a company in New York. Then he designed packaging for the pharmaceutical industry. His next position was Art Director and then Marketing Director in the Midwest. Gould’s wife, Karen, is from northwest Indiana on the Chicago side. After they were married they lived in different areas of the United States and in Canada. When Karen accepted a job at AT&T in 2001, they “fell in love with this area.”  Gould decided to become a stay-at-home dad and work as a freelancer doing illustration, graphic design and portraits when his children were born.  “I always loved the masters like Da Vinci and Rubens. Rockwell and Maxfield Parish were also some of my favorites. I also loved the French impressionists and nature and started doing oils, mainly for fun.” He was able to achieve his dream of having his work hang in homes and galleries as his children got older. Once they were more self-sufficient he immersed himself into painting his own masterpieces. Living in the Brookrace subdivision of Schiff enables him to explore the gorgeous nature preserve daily. “I walk my dog on the many trails every day of the year. I am never at a loss for the beauty that nature provides.”  In addition to enjoying Schiff, Gould noted, “My wife and I love hiking and scuba diving and nature in general. And trying to communicate that beauty with a paintbrush is my passion.” Gould won the Award of Excellence from The Center for Contemporary Art in Bernardsville for his “Schiff Meadow #2” painting over the summer.  Gould invites you to attend his October 5th Gallery Exhibit to enjoy his vibrant surrealistic painting, blues music and delicious food. A portion of the proceeds will be donated to the Schiff. The Alhamra Gallery & Art Center is located at 21 Clairmont Rd, Bernardsville. Mendham Artist Will Exhibit Paintings at Alhamra Gallery & Art Center in Bernardsville on October 5 added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "By Dawn M Chiossi  Going on since February of this year, Hackettstown’s Heath Village inspires their staff with its English Language Program.   This program is a class format, an offshoot of the Adult English Language Tutoring Program sponsored by the Literacy New Jersey Sussex Branch. This program is for any adult in Sussex or Warren Counties, who would like to improve their facility with English– making them more comfortable speaking English.    It has been said that education is a great equalizer. It opens doors to everyone; it stirs curiosity, accesses information, and lets the mind ponder, inquire and enjoy.   The English Language Program is spearheaded and run by two-year Heath Village resident, Marguerite Gadel, as well as Susan Sumner. Gadel explains that the program works with the State and Local Literacy New Jersey Organization’s Sussex Branch (a branch that expands to Warren County.)  Gadel herself had been a part of the literacy organization for an impressive 20 years.   Although relatively new, Heath Village’s program is an informal, inclusive one. It focuses mainly on spoken communication, conversational English, and some grammar and spelling.  Concentrating on how to be comfortable speaking English, students will learn enough to communicate easily in functional areas such as making appointments or filling out forms. The program seeks to make communications easier and much more fluid, both in work and social situations.   Additionally, the class will make it more enjoyable for students to follow a TV program or read a book. “I want them to really enjoy reading in English,” Gadel shares.   “There’s even some students in the class who are taking their test for citizenship. That’s a big job,” she prides.  Gadel explains that she came up with the idea of starting the program soon after she moved to Heath Village.   Immediately proposing the idea to Heath Village’s CEO to make the program available, and receiving an overwhelmingly positive response, she set to work.   Wanting the English Language Program to be engaging and relatable for the students, the program involves them right away by having them read out loud. “We try to jump on something of interest to the students or go over something from the week before that they had learned,” Gadel explains.    For these students, learning English is not a chore, but a pleasure.  Gadel can’t say enough about her students in general, admiring their determination and hard work ethic. “They come to class completely on their own time. Usually after working a full day. Then they’ll have to go home, take care of their families and do homework. It’s so impressive that they are willing to put in the time and effort to do this,” she enthuses.  They will even find creative ways to learn. For example, Gadel relates that one of her students will watch the news without subtitles to learn what is going on.  For Gadel, just the small act of using her talents to make a difference in the lives of others has created a ripple effect. “I love seeing the students help each other,” she says. “For instance, a student from Mexico will help someone from Colombia. It is wonderful to see that happen. It is thrilling to see them put in so much effort and work so hard to learn.”  Gadel sees with her own eyes how much of an impact the program is making to her students. They are not only learning but enjoying. What’s more, they are sharing that feeling and connection with others.  “I remember when the class discovered that Heath Village had a new resident, a lady from England who had been in England’s Royal Air Force (R.A.F.) in World War II,” Gadel shares. “A student had recently read an article to us regarding the R.A.F. Because of that, the class eagerly wanted to talk to this lady and ask her questions. They were so involved, asking about her experiences and how they were different in England as opposed to here in America. It was wonderful.”  The Literacy New Jersey Sussex Branch will be training new volunteers to be tutors beginning in late September.  Training for new tutors is offered in the spring and the fall. It is ideal for someone who would like to make a difference, no experience is necessary.  Training consists of three in-person meetings interspersed with online training. The first session is especially useful in helping people decide whether or not they would like to do the tutoring. “I would love to encourage some people to train for this great volunteer work. We always have waiting students,” Gadel enthuses. For further information or details on tutoring, please contact Literacy New Jersey Sussex County Office at 973-300-9444 or by visiting www.literacynj.orgHackettstown’s Heath Village Inspires Staff with English Language Program added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "How To Plan A Smooth Group Ski Trip(NAPSI)—According to a study from Wyndham Vacation Rentals, most travelers take ski and snowboard vacations in groups of four or more. Hitting the slopes with a big group doesn’t have to be hard, even when it comes to coordinating everyone’s schedules and travel arrangements.Group Ski Trip TipsWhile it can be challenging to keep everyone happy during the vacation, these planning hints can help get everyone started on the right foot.• Find the right lodging. When traveling with a larger group, alternative lodging options might be your best bet. A cabin, condo or home lets everyone stay together under one roof without sacrificing privacy. Everyone can have his or her own bedroom, while common spaces such as a living room or dining room make spending time together easy.

When researching lodging, see if your accommodations rest along a community shuttle route or offer their own shuttle services. Also look into the destination’s transit systems. Sun Valley, for example, offers free bus service. If you’re renting a car, make sure you plan for times when the group splits up. Leaving half the group stranded won’t make for a fun situation.• Agree on activities beforehand. While skiing and snowboarding may be the top priorities, there are plenty of other activities to do during a ski trip. From dogsledding and snow tubing to unique local festivals, you might find attractions you just don’t want to miss. Have everyone weigh in on top choices before the trip, especially those who are attending but who aren’t avid skiers or snowboarders. Considering everyone’s preferences in advance can help reduce stress during the trip itself.• Give everyone some downtime. Opinions often differ, especially within larger groups, so allow for flexibility during the trip. If your muscles are begging for a break, read a book or squeeze in a post-run nap while your fellow travelers stay on the slopes. If half of the group wants to head downtown for the afternoon while the other half wants to get in another mountain activity, split up for a few hours. By staying flexible with the group’s itinerary, you’ll avoid any tension and better enjoy the time you all spend together.Learn MoreTo start your planning now, you can visit www.WyndhamVacationRentals.com for deals on vacation rental homes in some of North America’s top ski destinations.How To Plan A Smooth Group Ski Trip added by new_view_media on December 22, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      " The Morris County Board of Freeholders invites the public to join them in observing the 14th anniversary of 9/11 at a Remembrance Service and Candlelight Vigil on Sun., Sept. 13.The ceremony will begin at 5 p.m. at the Morris County September 11th Memorial on West Hanover Avenue in Parsippany-Troy Hills, across from the Morris View Healthcare Center and adjacent to the Morris County Public Safety Academy.The event will include a march with a color guard up West Hanover Avenue to the Memorial by police, fire, rescue and emergency personnel from across Morris County.The observance will include a special invocation, a lighting of candles, and reading of the names of each of the Morris County victims, plus a 21-gun salute, and keynote remarks.Elizabeth Schrier, the widow of the late Freeholder Jack Schrier, who was instrumental in getting Morris County’s 9/11 Memorial constructed, will carry the American flag during the ceremony.Morris County’s September 11th Memorial pays tribute to all of those who died in the terrorist attacks in New York, Pennsylvania and Washington D.C., on Sept. 11, 2001, with a special emphasis on the 64 victims from Morris County whose names are etched in plaques that are affixed to the Memorial.The names of all of the nearly 3,000 people who died that day are engraved in ruby-colored paving stones that have been set in the ground as a walkway surrounding the Memorial.“It is vitally important to gather each year on the anniversary of 9/11 to recall every single one of the nearly 3,000 people who were tragically lost to us on that day, including 64 of our Morris County residents,’’ said Freeholder Director Kathy DeFillippo. “Their families and friends should know that the lives of their loved ones will never be forgotten.’’Since seating at the Memorial is limited, the public is encouraged to bring lawn chairs to the outdoor observance. Parking will be available at the Morris County Department of Human Services building at 340 West Hanover Ave., in Morris Township – across from the Academy. Shuttle buses will be available to transport those in need to the Memorial.The freeholders also invite police and fire departments and rescue squads from across the county to participate by sending one apparatus per department and assembling at 6 p.m. at the Morris County Public Safety Academy, 500 West Hanover Ave., in Parsippany-Troy Hills.

      "St. Virgil Group Helps Keep Morris Plains Cleaner And Litter FreeAs the weather gets warmer, groups will be spreading out across Morris Plains to pick up litter and recyclables that have been carelessly tossed along roadways and in parks. The first to participate this year were a group of twelve students from St. Virgil.\n",
      "The St. Virgil group uses their mini grant money to help fund their yearly trip to Appalachia to help do work in this very depressed area. Along with two adults the young people were out on a chilly and drizzly first weekend in April to scour Simones Park. They picked up seven large bags of trash and two large bags of recyclables.\n",
      "Simones Park, at the end of Mountain Way, has been adopted by the sixth grade students from Borough School that have pledged to go out and clean the park four times a year. But Simones Park is a problem area. Even with the Borough School group, extra clean-ups, like this one by St. Virgil, and the help of neighbors that live across the street, litter is a consistent problem. Banners in the park with the litter program logo “Pick Up Morris Plains – Keep Us Litter Free” as a reminder to visitors have helped, but not enough.\n",
      "Litter is unhealthy, unsightly, and can be a safety hazard. Simones Park not only has soccer fields and open areas, but also has a well-used playground, so that broken bottles and crushed cans could lead to injuries.\n",
      "Anyone can help stop litter by using the many recycling containers and trash cans placed throughout the parks, as well as all along the main street, Speedwell Avenue. There is also a recycling container placed across the street from the train station. But even more important, the attitude that causes people to litter must be changed. People tend to think that somebody else will clean up litter left in the street or on the sidewalk, especially in places where there already is a lot of litter or places where the sense of community pride is low.\n",
      "Morris Plains wants everyone to take responsibility for their actions and pride in the environment and the town – don’t litter, put trash and recyclables in their proper place!\n",
      "Morris Plains Councilman John “Jack” Doherty is the liaison to the Clean Communities and Recycling programs and he commended the mini grant groups saying, “We are pleased that so many groups come out during the year to help with litter pickups, but hope our residents will keep our town a “community of caring” and do their part.”\n",
      "The groups that participate receive grant funds from the State Clean Communities Program. Penny Manser is head of the Youth Ministry at St. Virgil and said that, “The mission trip we take each summer is ten days of working with the people of Harlan, Kentucky, the 18th poorest county in the United States. The families there are picked by lottery for help with roofing, plumbing, painting, ditch digging, sheet rock work, siding, clean up from floods or whatever is needed by these local families. It is our opportunity to truly work as disciples in the world, and to learn to be grateful for the gifts that we have.”\n",

      "Morris Arts recently opened a 15th exhibit, entitled Black, White and Green at the Gallery in Morristown.  Guest curator Katherine Murdock, the Exhibition Committee of Morris Arts and the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation selected works by several outstanding artists in New Jersey and New York.\n",
      "Inspired by the biowall, the vertical garden of living plants within the exhibit space, Murdock chose to focus the exhibit on plants and selected the title, Black, White and Green, to purposefully reflect that limited color palette as a means of unifying the exhibit. What is striking, however, is the richness and variety of the artists’ unique approaches to the theme – through their use of different media (collage, oil, cold wax painting, photography, charcoal drawings, wood sculpture, etc.), composition, and subtle gradations of color.As Murdock notes, “Casey Ruble’s paper collage illustrates a bundled bouquet of invasive plant species and Kathy Cantwell’s oil and cold wax on panel explores green color fields that resemble landscape. Richard Bottwin uses plant material as a medium and highlights the wood grain with stain and paint.”The public is invited to view this exciting exhibit, open Mon.-Fri. from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and by appointment, and will remain on display until Aug. 24.  Visit www.morrisarts.org<https://www.morrisarts.org or call 973- 285-5115 for additional information.Morris Arts located in Morristown is a not-for-profit organization founded in 1973 dedicated to building community through the artsBlack, White, Green Art Exhibit Featured In Gallery added by new_view_media on March 19, 2016View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Locals Volunteer To Build A Better Life In GuatemalaBy Cheryl ConwayBeyond the conditions many can relate to, outside the walls of what’s the norm, exists a world so difficult to imagine unless one visits and reaches out to help.In Guatemala City, 11,000 people- in which 7,000 are kids- live and work inside a garbage dump.“Most survive by picking through the trash to earn less than five dollars a day. Many find their daily food in the dump.”Just when all hopelessness is lost for these human beings living in one of the most impoverished areas , more and more volunteers are stepping up to assist and steer them to a better life. Some local people have become very involved and formed an organization known as Beyond The Walls. This month, 75 individuals are volunteering to visit the Guatemala City Garbage Dump to build houses, donate clothing and shoes and organize sport clinics.The non-profit organization started in 2007 at the Mendham Hills Community Church, although mission teams were sent out before.“We had been going to Guatemala for a couple of years,” explains Betsy Ahl of Morris Township, executive director of Beyond The Walls. “The church was sending mission teams. We asked volunteers to help raise money to help pay for trips, build houses. They’d raise more money and that would go toward projects.”In order to influence others outside the church to get involved, and to receive matching grants from volunteers’ employers, organizers decided to expand the church group to a secular, non-profit organization, explains Ahl.The idea to help the people of Guatemala dates back to 2005, when Mendham was named one of the top wealthiest places to live in America.“The elders of Mendham Hills Chapel thought this wasn’t how others lived,” explains Ahl, “so they asked the chairman of the missions’ team to find an area that needed help.”One of the poorest places in the world, the Guatemala City Garbage Dump, was identified by a church member and the idea to team up with the Potter’s House organization, with a mission to eradicate poverty, build houses, help others get business loans and establish community programs.“It’s a ravine right in the center of the Capitol City,” describes Ahl. “They’ve been filling it up with garbage for 50 years.”In their first mission, Ahl joined 26 others for four days. The group, after that, “could have gone to Africa one year, China one year,” but the group decided it was more important to “come back and form long term relationships,” says Ahl who has sponsored three kids in Guatemala in the Kids In Potter House Education Program, in which 50 kids are sponsored to receive an education. Ahl has been sponsoring these kids since they were in the first grade, are now graduating high school and will be supported through college.Church member and organization volunteer, Mike Rubright, 50, of Long Valley, is currently on one of three missions to Guatemala this month through Beyond The Walls. His ninth trip out there during the past seven years, Rubright and his daughter, Erin, are working in the garbage dump from July 18-25.Another one of his daughters, Emily, has gone on the trip seven times but had to miss this one. Youth volunteers must be starting atleast seventh grade to participate, so for Erin this is her third trip. Volunteers must contribute $1,600 each in order to participate, with funds going toward flight and lodging; and additional funds to supplies and building houses. Every year, Rubright sends letters and emails to friends requesting donations to help support his volunteer work.About 75 people have signed up through Beyond The Walls to volunteer during the three missions this month, with 10 people from the Mendham, Long Valley and Chester areas. The others are from areas throughout the country such as Florida, New York and Texas, who formed their own groups with Beyond The Walls.Rubright and his wife, Katie, have a niece who was adopted from Guatemala so their connection is even greater.“I do construction all day long,” says Rubright. “I had no idea what I was doing; I had no construction experience. Now I’m the person in charge of construction projects my week.“Everybody builds, everybody works; it doesn’t matter how old you are,” says Rubright, principal at the Woodglen Middle School in Lebanon Twp.“We build a concrete block house with a concrete floor,” he explains. “We mix concrete by hand; it’s the hardest thing I’ve ever done. The girls and women work harder than I’ve ever seen; they don’t stop.” A family that is getting a house built works beside the volunteers.“It’s not very big,” he says, with the homes about 15 feet by 15 feet,” the size of a bedroom. Homes are for four to five person families, and sometimes six to eight people.It’s like “nine people living in the size of your kitchen,” describes Ahl. Homes are built side by side and cost $5,600 to build.A completed house consists of one big room with one eight-foot partition wall that separates the bedrooms from “everything else,” says Rubright. “They have a toilet and a shower stall” in an area about the size of a closet, and they get “a big concrete sink” that can weigh up to 600 pounds, which is used for all washing needs such as dishes and clothes.Rubright also works under Guatemala masons who are very particular with how they want things to be completed, he says.“They tell us what to do,” says Rubright. “There are a lot of times we do things that don’t make sense; you can’t tell them they are wrong. That’s frustrating. If they tell you to put a hole in a concrete pipe with a hammer and nails, instead of a drill, you do it.”The homes that are being built for the people in the Guatemala City Garbage Dump is luxury compared to the “cardboard sheet metal,” dirt, chemicals, methane gas that surround them and sicken them while living in the dump and “breathing the trash.”These houses also provide shelter and protection for these people, says Rubright, as gun shots are commonly fired in the garbage dump.His goal during this one week visit is to build three to five houses with his group of volunteers.Potter’s House has built 110 homes to date, with 75 contributed by the volunteers of Beyond The Walls, says Ahl, who visits four times, about six weeks a year.In addition to building homes, the volunteers lead soccer clinics and donate uniforms, soccer balls and cleats as well as baseball clinics and donations of t-shirts; help at a medical clinic, vacation Bible school, and deliver groceries and visit families.Through their efforts, much progress has been made such as concrete roads, a community center built last year, education programs which is much needed as the average kid does not go past fifth grade in Guatemala, says Rubright.“A lot of families look at education as not important,” says Rubright. “A lot end up working in the garbage dump” as scavengers. “They make money picking out recyclables. People sift through trash looking through recyclables to see what they can sell” or “they are looking for food to eat it.” Parents stop sending their kids to school because they need their school age kids to watch younger siblings so parents can work.If they are not scavengers, they rely on the garbage dump to sell their own goods, like tortillas to the scavengers so they can eat, and even jewelry, says Ahl.“It’s just this culture of poverty,” says Ahl, with high unemployment. “Education is not a value, that’s the bottom line. Potter’s House tries to teach the value of education especially to the parents.” It also tries to teach the vendors who do sell inside the garbage dump to sell on the outside, says Ahl.“But without education, it’s really, really hard to move their way out of the dump,” says Ahl.Scavengers are even making less these days. As the economy declined, so did the value of recyclables, explains Rubright. For those working 10 to 12 hour days, they are making two to three dollars.While “there are guns everywhere, “Rubright admits that he feels safe when there.“The organization we are with is well respected,” he says, and they stay in a retreat center with accommodations like that of a motel or college dorm. “We are safe; every store has an armed guard,” and no one walks alone. “We have relationships with people. We go to the same neighborhoods. There’s more of a comfort level now. It’s a safe place- I bring my kids there I’m not in fear of our lives.”It is the desire to help others and the appreciation that brings Rubright back to the dump.He says, “If there’s really a God, why does he let that happen? We let it happen by not choosing to use our resources that way. I don’t think I could not go back. They have so little but they appreciate everything they have. We have so much and we want so much more.”They say, “This morning I lived in a garbage dump; now I live in a mansion.”Rubright admits, “I’ve learned more from them than they get from me. I’m a better person in Guatemala than I am here.”Also nice is the community bond shared by the volunteers.For the last five or six years, the same group of people have been volunteering. “Everyone enjoys each other’s company,” say Rubright. “We work hard all day, you come back eat dinner. There’s community; there’s no television, little internet, no cell services. It’s a lot what life should be like.”Like Ahl, the Rubrights have sponsored a girl there since she was eight; now she is 17. Through their support they have helped Jennifer Lopez Munoz continue to go to school and get an education.Rubright tells people, “I have three daughters in America and one in Guatemala.”“All the kids down there, they know when we come back,” says Rubright. “It’s humbling; it’s like family.” Volunteers bring with them bags of clothing and shoes for more than 200 kids.Beyond the Walls has helped other communities outside of Guatemala, such as Native Americans, homeless people in Dover and in Newark.Rubright plans to volunteer at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota next, which is known as the poorest place in the U.S., next to Haiti, from alcoholism and unemployment faced by Native Americans. “This was their country and they are at the bottom of the ladder.”Beyond the Walls is always seeking more volunteers, contributions for clothing and shoes, and financial support.Its next mission to the garbage dump is Oct. 24-31, with already 20 people signed up.Go to Beyondthewalls.org for more information. To volunteer, email gobeyomdthewalls@gmail.com.“I encourage people to go, go somewhere,” says Rubright, Long Valley softball coach for the past 14 years and former school board member. “Find something to do where you can do something for someone else. There are people everywhere who need something. You do not need to be religious. Some people think it’s a church thing – it’s people helping other people.”Locals Volunteer To Build A Better Life In Guatemala added by new_view_media on August 18, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "On Sun., Sept. 13 Macculloch Hall Historical Museum welcomes Linda J. Barth from the Canal Society of New Jersey (CSNJ) Barth will present a program about The Delaware and Raritan Canal (D&R). The D&R is one of the subjects of the current second floor gallery exhibit “Canals of New Jersey” which will be available to view prior to the presentation.Canal author and historian Linda J. Barth will introduce the people, the bridges, the locks, and the aqueducts that made D&R Canal work. This waterway, now a “greenway” and the centerpiece of a popular state park, transported men and supplies between New York and Philadelphia during three wars. Inventor John Holland used the canal to deliver his Holland VI submarine to Washington for its Navy trials, and luxury yachts, like J .P. Morgan’s Tarantula, cruised the waterway.For more than 170 years, the D&R Canal has meandered across the narrow waist of New Jersey and was one of the nation’s most successful towpath canals, carrying more tonnage in 1866 than the more famous Erie Canal. Johnson & Johnson, Roebling, and Fleischmann’s Distillery all had their start along the D&R. These days the canal provides the people of central New Jersey with both a water supply and a premier recreational facility. Today, the Morris Canal Greenway, a partnership between local communities and the Canal Society of New Jersey, seeks to preserve the surviving historic remains of the canal, interpret canal sites, and offer recreational opportunities to the public. In this presentation Linda will discuss the history and operation of the canal and how it is used today.MHHM opens at 1 p.m. on Sept. 13 and visitors who arrive prior to the 4:30 p.m. program can enjoy the “Canals of New Jersey” exhibit. MHHM has partnered with CSNJ to present this display of panels that tell the story of New Jersey’s two towpath canals, the Morris and the Delaware and Raritan. The CSNJ’s display is supplemented by objects including some from MHHM’s collection and information about Macculloch Hall founder George Macculloch who had the idea for the Morris Canal. The exhibit shares some of the stories of the workers and families who lived and worked on the canal, as well as other details about its construction using photographs and drawings, as well objects such as model canal boats.Tickets for the program go on sale from 1 p.m., no advance sales, and remain on sale until the presentation begins at 4:30 p.m. Speaker tickets include admission to the museum exhibits during the afternoon and a guided tour of period rooms, the last tour ticket is sold at 3 p.m. Speaker tickets will remain on sale until 4:30 p.m.The Museum’s second floor “The Civil War Through the Eyes of Thomas Nast” and “Canals of New Jersey” exhibits will remain on view until 4:30 p.m. The first floor “Thomas Nast: Unknown Works and American Icons” exhibit will close 3:30 p.m. – 4 p.m. in preparation for the program. Tickets to hear speakers are Adults $8; Seniors & Students $6; Children 6 – 12 $4. Members and children under 5 are admitted free.For more information call Karen Hollywood, Publicity and Programs Coordinator Macculloch Hall Historical Museum at (973) 538-2404 ext. 15.Linda Barth To Speak At MHHM added by new_view_media on August 16, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "An Evening with The Monkees\n",
      "Featuring Micky Dolenz and Peter TorkThursday, August 27 at 8 pm(Morristown) – Hey, hey it’s The Monkees, featuring Micky Dolenz and Peter Tork, coming to Mayo Performing Arts Center on Thursday, August 27, 2015 at 8 pm. Tickets are $49-99.When four young men were cast in the television roles of a struggling rock band inspired by The Beatles’ A Hard Day’s Night, few could have predicted the impact The Monkees would make on music and pop culture at large, an impact that still reverberates 50 years later.Assembled in Los Angeles in 1965 by Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider for the television series The Monkees, the quartet of Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith, Peter Tork, and the late Davy Jones brought a singular mix of pop, rock, psychedelica, Broadway, and country to their music. The show itself, meanwhile, paid tribute not only to The Beatles, but also to the comedy stylings of The Marx Brothers and Laurel and Hardy as well as the pop-art sensibilities of Warhol and the emerging San Francisco psychedelic scene.The Monkees’ first single, “Last Train to Clarksville,” was released in August 1966, hitting #1 and serving as advance publicity for their series, which debuted on September 12. When the group’s self-titled debut album arrived in stores a month later, it quickly headed for the top spot of the Billboard charts, where it would ultimately sit for 13 of the 78 weeks it remained in the Top 200. (Two decades later, in the midst of a new burst of Monkee-mania, The Monkees popped back onto the charts, bringing the total number of weeks to 102.)By the time the group’s TV series aired its final new episode on March 25, 1968, the Monkees had seen three further albums top the charts – More of the Monkees, Headquarters, and Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones, Ltd., all of which were released in 1967, staggeringly enough – while racking up several more hit singles, with “I’m a Believer,” “(I’m Not Your) Steppin’ Stone,” “A Little Bit Me, A Little Bit You,” “The Girl I Knew Somewhere,” “Pleasant Valley Sunday,” “Words,”  “Daydream Believer,” “Valleri,” and “Tapioca Tundra” all finding their way into the Billboard Top 40.After the series’ two-season run, the group went on to star in the cult feature film HEAD (co-written by Jack Nicholson) and a TV special (33 1/3 Revolutions per Monkee) while also continuing to record new material, but much as the ’60s gave way to the ’70s, the members of the Monkees eventually gave in to their individual musical interests and went their separate ways. for awhile.In February 1986, after MTV broadcast a marathon of The Monkees, Dolenz, Jones, and Tork reunited for a 20th anniversary tour, with Nesmith joining them onstage for the Los Angeles date of the tour, and in 1996, all four members of the group reunited for a new album (Justus) and TV special (Hey, Hey, It’s the Monkees).In the wake of Jones’s death on February 29, 2012, the surviving members of the Monkees reunited and performed a series of concerts. The shows were greeted with sell-out response and phenomenal reviews. Now, Micky Dolenz and Peter Tork carry on that tradition with a full evening of magic music and multi-media splendor, including clips from their Emmy Award winning series. Their new show features all of the Monkees hits, plus an intimate acoustic set and solo spots for each of the singers. An Evening With The Monkees is sure to please every fan of the band.Mayo Performing Arts Center, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, presents a wide range of programs that entertain, enrich, and educate the diverse population of the region and enhance the economic vitality of Northern New Jersey. The 2015-2016 season is made possible, in part, by a grant the New Jersey State Council on the Arts/Department of State, a Partner Agency of the National Endowment for the Arts, as well as support received from the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation, F.M. Kirby Foundation and numerous corporations, foundations and individuals.

      "Many in the Morristown community and beyond knew Myles Mislavsky (Morristown High School – Class of 2013). His smile was contagious and his friendliness was well-known. To honor his life, his family – Hector Mislavsky, Judy Martinez and Jessie Mislavsky – has created a college-debt forgiveness fund – the Myles Smiled on You Award – for Morristown High School alumni to be administered by the Morris Educational Foundation. The award, for secondary education loan reduction, will be given to deserving MHS alumni who exemplify Myles’ many positive characteristics. It was created to reduce the burden of debt many students carry after college making it hard for them to save and get ahead. The award is funded by family, friends and the Golden Bagel Runners who knew and loved Myles. Myles was an amazing human being. Witty, charismatic, giving and loyal…these words merely scratch the surface in describing Myles. He made a lasting impact on the lives of those around him and was committed to helping others. He radiated joy with a smile so infectious that even on your worst days, he lifted your spirit. People were drawn to Myles and were better having known him. The award application is open to all Morristown High School alumni – Class of 2009 and after – who have graduated from a college, university or trade school (2 or 4 year) and have student loans. In 2019, this scholarship will be awarded to multiple alumni who graduated after 2009, at least one of whom graduated with Myles in 2013. In addition to demonstrating college debt burden, the award application requires 3 – 250 word or less essays: how have you dealt with challenging situations (mental or physical health, or other) and how did you or are you dealing with those challenges; describe how you have demonstrated empathy toward others; and what do you do to help your family/community, as well as a letter of recommendation. “We are honored to administer the Myles Smiled On You Award on behalf of the Mislavsky/Martinez family. We are so grateful to our donors, like the Mislavskys/Martinez Family, whose generosity inspires and impacts our Morristown High School community,” said Patty Haralampoudis, the Chair of the Morris Educational Foundation. It is the hope of the Mislavsky/Martinez Family that with this financial award, Myles will “smile on” Morristown High School alumni just as he did during his amazing life. Morris Educational Foundation Announces Myles Smiled on You Award for College-Debt Forgiveness Created in honor of Myles Mislavsky  added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "By Jerry Del Priore  On September 13th, the Mayo Performing Arts Center (MPAC) kicked off its 25th anniversary with a fabulous concert by singer/actress and American Idol finalist Katherine McPhee. MPAC, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, has been at the center of Morristown’s revitalization and is a major reason why it’s a nightlife hotspot today, with several wonderful bars and restaurants lining its lively streets since its inception, according to General Manager Ed Kirchdoerffer. “Twenty-five years ago, Morristown wasn’t the popular town it is now,” Kirchdoerffer, a Morristown native, said. “We feel the opening of the performing arts center was part of the rebuilding of Morristown. It’s been an anchor for improvement.” Top musical and comedic acts have performed at MPAC over the years, from Foreigner and Daughtry to Melissa Ethridge and Wayne Brady, and every great entertainer in between. Moreover, MPAC doesn’t have any plans of slowing down any time soon. Musical performers such as America, Kenny G, Joan Jett and the Blackhearts and Ruben Studdard will be hitting the stage in October. “We feel we’re still in a growth cycle,” Kirchdoerffer said. “We constantly challenge ourselves to grow and invest in ourselves to make the best possible events.”  Kirchdoerffer said some of the ways MPAC will be celebrating its 25 years in Morristown are by holding a few free concerts, ask its performance-goers, on social media, to name their favorite moments since its opening, and have a number of $25 ticket offers, to name a few.  However, MPAC is more than a concert hall for some of today’s greatest acts. It also offers a Performing Arts School (PAS), founded in 2006, which now serves approximately 700 students per year with over 20 classes a week within a supportive and creative atmosphere. Students ages five to 18 come from all over Northern New Jersey to learn performance technique while building confidence and having a great time. Classes are offered in musical theatre, acting, singing technique, song presentation, improvisation, private voice and adult cabaret. “The emphasis isn’t placed on being a star,” Kirchdoerffer explained. “It’s placed on being part of a team, being part of the creative process. They really get a full immersive experience. Everyone’s so encouraging of everyone else.” While most of the kids don’t enter the entertainment world, Kirchdoerffer noted that they will gain valuable skills that will help them succeed in life. “Most won’t go on to become performers,” he said, “but they will learn important life skills that will go a long way, whether it’s in the boardroom or other areas of work.”Additionally, MPAC offers The Miracle Project, a fully inclusive music and theatre program for children with autism of all levels. “It’s been a very powerful program,” Kirchdoerffer said. “This is a program that grew organically. Many parents have spoken about (their experiences) and are happy to see their kids enjoy themselves. This (program) gives them a safe haven. They get to have fun while being themselves.” There’s also an Art Upstairs Gallery, located in the balcony lobby of MPAC, which showcases visual artists from a variety of disciplines, including watercolor, oils, photography, sculpture and more. Each year, the works of over 200 artists are showcased in group exhibits. Each display hangs from six to eight weeks.With all the success MPAC has experienced over the last 25 years, Kirchdoerffer said he hopes to see more prosperous years ahead for the Morristown institution, which has been a staple in the thriving town. “We have been here for 25 years and hope to do it for 25 more years and beyond,” he said. “It’s been the town’s heartbeat.” For more information on MPAC’s educational programs, Art Upstairs Gallery, and a list of upcoming performances, go to www.mayoarts.org. Mayo Performing Arts Center Celebrates 25 Years of Prosperity  added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "By Dawn M Chiossi  Morristown High School Graduate Amelia Langan has certainly been busy. Thanks to her recent activities in raising awareness about organ and tissue donation, she founded a Donate Life club at her school and was one of six students awarded a scholarship for the 2019-2020 academic year from the New Jersey Sharing Network.   The New Jersey Sharing Network is committed to saving and enhancing lives through organ donation. Giving a second chance at life, organ and tissue donation does just that. Just making that one decision can save lives, and make a huge, enriching impact on the lives of others.   As Langan discovered, it can also do the same thing for the self.   Like most people, Langan became aware of the importance of organ donation only when she took her driver’s education class in school. In hearing speaker– and liver transplant recipient–Michele Dabal, she became aware of how organ donation can impact and benefit others.  “She cleared up a lot of misconceptions and concerns that people have regarding organ donation,” Langan explains. “Hearing her story on how organ donation helped her to survive really resonated with me,” Langan shares.  Langan was so inspired by Dabal, she began to do her own research regarding organ donation, about how many lives could be changed for the better. It soon became a cause she became passionate about.   “One person can save up to eight lives with organ donation, and up to fifty with tissue donation,” she enthuses.  Langan was awarded the scholarship for diligently volunteering with the New Jersey Sharing Network, devoting an impressive 80 hours to volunteering.  Additionally, she raised awareness regarding organ and tissue donation for her Girl Scout Gold Award project.    Wanting to inspire others regarding organ donation, Langan founded a Donate Life club at her high school. The club came into existence during her junior year of 2017.    Describing Morristown’s Donate Life club as a small one of approximately 20-25 members, they do so much. Members volunteer with the New Jersey Sharing Network. Additionally, the club lined up speakers for people to hear inspiring stories regarding their organ and tissue donations.  For Langan, the goal was to get people talking about organ donation and to start a conversation about it. The club did this in a variety of ways.   “This is such an easy way to make a positive impact in our country. Organ donation affects everyone everywhere (even globally). It is so widespread,” she asserts. Through her passion and research, Langan and the club discovered that in Morristown alone, approximately 21 people were on the list looking for a transplant. “Everyone knows someone affected.”  Although Langan is a Freshman at Boston’s Northeastern University and is already fully committed to majoring in behavioral neuroscience and minoring in biochemistry to go into the field of research for cancer, she still is helping in the cause close to her heart. She has extended the parameters of the club, creating a video explaining and inspiring other high school students how they can help in the cause of organ donation and create a Donate Life club of their own.  Langan’s excitement to inspire others to make a difference through organ and tissue donation has even extended to her sister and her sister’s best friend. Both are going to take up the mantle of Morristown’s Donate Life club, to put their own ideas to it.   For Langan, everything is connected and stems from the information and inspiration she received from Driver’s Ed class. “I was so surprised to receive the scholarship,” she shares. “I didn’t think I had a chance of winning. It was Michele who persuaded me to apply. If I hadn’t met her, I wouldn’t have been inspired to do any of this. It wasn’t just me, (being awarded the scholarship or success of the club) so many people were a beacon of encouragement. From Michele, to Brooke, and Daniel Sarnowski at New Jersey Sharing Network, to so many others behind the scenes. I’m very grateful.”Changing the World, Raising Awareness About Organ and Tissue Donation, Morristown Grad Founds Donate Life Club, Wins Scholarship added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "By Henry M. HoldenThe Morristown Festival of Books is an annual two-day event that takes place this year on October 11 and 12. According to Rachel Barry, Director of the Morristown Festival of Books, “The 6-year-old event is modeled after successful book festivals in other communities throughout the world. Each autumn, the festival brings together authors with readers and book lovers. The Festival is New Jersey’s premier book festival, celebrating the written word’s power to challenge, transport and transform.” Barry says the festival is growing each year. “We started with about 1,500 visitors six years ago and last year we hosted over 8,000.”The opening night is a ticketed Keynote Event featuring Preet Bharara who served as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York from 2009 to 2017. In 2017, Bharara joined the NYU School of Law faculty as a Distinguished Scholar in Residence. Bharara will speak on Friday evening at the Mayo Performing Arts Center at 7:30pm. Tickets will be available through the MPAC box office and on the festival website. Tickets are also available at the door on the night of the event, as availability allows.The Main Festival takes place all day on Saturday (10 a.m. – 5 p.m.), rain or shine.This year’s festival features more than 50 authors. Author selections featuring various genres are designed to appeal to a variety of ages and reading interests. “Authors will be speaking and answering questions in informal one-hour indoor sessions at five festival venues throughout the day,” said Barry. “Immediately following his or her talk, you will have the opportunity to speak with your favorite authors and have your books personalized at the Author Signing Tent, on the Vail Mansion lawn.” These sessions are free, no tickets required; general seating is on a first-come, first-served basis. There will also be portable restrooms at the Vail Mansion lawn. “The Festival center is on the lawn in front of the historic Vail Mansion (110 South Street), where there is an Information Tent, a Book Tent selling copies of the visiting authors’ books, the Signing Tent where authors will greet visitors and sign books, and concession stands selling refreshments.”“This year’s closing event is an exciting interactive event called Pitchapalooza,” said Barry. “It’s like American Idol for books (only without Simon). Anyone with an idea for a book has the chance to pitch it to a panel of judges. But they get only one minute.”The hosts, Arielle Eckstut and David Henry Sterry (a.k.a. The Book Doctors) team up with guest industry insiders to form the judging panel. The Judges critique everything from idea to style to potential in the marketplace and much more. Whether potential authors pitch themselves, or simply listen to trained professionals critique each presentation, Pitchapaloozas are educational and entertaining for all. All attendees come away with concrete advice on how to improve their pitch as well as a greater understanding of the ins and outs of the publishing industry.At the end of each Pitchapalooza, the judges come together to pick a winner. That winner receives an introduction by Eckstut and Sterry to an agent or publisher who is appropriate for their work. The Festival audience will also have a chance to pick a winning pitch. That Audience Choice winner will be voted on by the audience and will receive a 30-minute phone consultation from Eckstut and Sterry (a $150 value).KidFest @ MFOB includes author talks, signings, and fun activities all day for children up to 12 years old. Additionally, concessions will be available in the KidFest outdoor area outside the Presbyterian Church Parish House at 65 South Street. Please note, the festival is not held on the Morristown Green. There are several public parking garages within walking distance of the Festival center. This is a casual event. Wear comfortable walking shoes and be prepared for cool weather. It is a rain or shine event, so please bring an umbrella if the day’s weather warrants it. For more information and a list of authors attending see: www.morristownbooks.orgThe Morristown Festival of Books is Back added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "By: Jason Cohen Swimming runs in the blood of Jack Alexy. All of his siblings are swimmers, but he will be the first to have the chance to be in the Olympics. In June 2020, the Mendham resident will be competing against 1500 people in the Olympic Trials for swimming in Omaha, Neb. “I’m not going to know how it feels until I’m there,” Alexy said. “I know I’m definitely going to be nervous.” Alexy, 16, is a junior at Delbarton School in Morristown and has been swimming for the Somerset Hills YMCA Swim team in Basking Ridge since he was 8. After watching his older siblings Kate, 20, and Max, 18, swim; he quickly fell in love with the sport and followed in their footsteps. While his parents Lynn and Matt were not swimmers, they felt it was important for their children to learn. Their younger brother, Rob, 15, also swims.“My parents just wanted all of their kids to know how to swim for safety,” Alexy explained. Alexy said Kate and Max had a big influence on him. Swimming brought them closer and they taught him to never give up and always stay calm. In fact, Kate swims at Kenyon College in Ohio and Alexy hopes to swim in college as well. Alexy also played basketball, but quit in eighth grade to focus on swimming.He started to realize he had a future in swimming three years ago when he made the YMCA Nationals team. After that, he made nationals the next three years.Today swimming is a huge part of his life. He practices six days a week for two hours a day and has a few dry practices as well. In fact, he met some of his best friends from swimming.“That’s one of the best things about swimming, the people and the bonds,” he commented. In 2016 Lori Riegler took over as his coach. Over the past few years they have gotten close and she has helped him become a better swimmer. Alexy knows he has a long road ahead as he prepares for the Olympic Trials. He qualified for the 50 and 100 meter freestyle and in order to make the Olympics has to finish top two in an event. Right now he trains by swimming 25 yards, but in the trials it is 50 meters. So, in February, he will change his to 50. “It’s pretty crazy,” he said. “I still got a lot of work to do before then.”In August, he had a bit of a preview of what it will be like at the trials when he participated in the World Junior Championships in Budapest, Hungary. It was his first intentional competition. “It’s (Olympic Trials) definitely special,’ he said. “I got a little taste of that over the summer in Budapest.” Mendham Resident to Compete in Olympic Trials for Swimming  added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "By: Elise Phillips Margulis  Mendham-based artist Jeff Gould, known for his stunning fine art landscapes and abstract Surrealistic compositions, is having an  exhibition called “Views from Schiff” which will feature paintings directly from and inspired by Schiff Nature Preserve in Mendham.  Gould will be showing his “nature and animal surreal mashups” as well. The exhibit will also include Japanese-inspired artwork by artist Al Gunther www.dragonflystudios-algunther.com.” The “Views from Schiff” exhibit will be on October 5th from 4:00 to 6:00 p.m. at the Alhamra Gallery and Art Center in Bernardsville. Blues legend Barry Blues will play a music set and refreshments will be served. The entertainment and food are free. Some of the proceeds will go to Schiff Nature Preserve. Gould hails from New Rochelle, NY. He recalls being “artistic at a very early age and copying cartoons out of the newspaper, including Charlie Brown for a piece of promotional material for my kindergarten class.” He drew “Mad Magazine” characters when he was a bit older. Gould also enjoyed drawing superheroes. Some of his favorite artists and inspirations are Mort Drucker and Don Martin. Gould’s biggest childhood artist influence was Norman Rockwell. “I used to sit down for hours with pencil and paper trying to copy his paintings,” shared Gould.  “Oddly, we seem to occupy the same towns. From growing up in New Rochelle where he lived, to spending summers in the Berkshires where his main studio was.” Gould added, “And now I live in the Schiff on Rockwell Court which was named after him because he had a studio here and painted some of the early covers of the Boy Scout manuals!” After Gould graduated from University of the Arts in Philadelphia, he designed toys for a company in New York. Then he designed packaging for the pharmaceutical industry. His next position was Art Director and then Marketing Director in the Midwest. Gould’s wife, Karen, is from northwest Indiana on the Chicago side. After they were married they lived in different areas of the United States and in Canada. When Karen accepted a job at AT&T in 2001, they “fell in love with this area.”  Gould decided to become a stay-at-home dad and work as a freelancer doing illustration, graphic design and portraits when his children were born.  “I always loved the masters like Da Vinci and Rubens. Rockwell and Maxfield Parish were also some of my favorites. I also loved the French impressionists and nature and started doing oils, mainly for fun.” He was able to achieve his dream of having his work hang in homes and galleries as his children got older. Once they were more self-sufficient he immersed himself into painting his own masterpieces. Living in the Brookrace subdivision of Schiff enables him to explore the gorgeous nature preserve daily. “I walk my dog on the many trails every day of the year. I am never at a loss for the beauty that nature provides.”  In addition to enjoying Schiff, Gould noted, “My wife and I love hiking and scuba diving and nature in general. And trying to communicate that beauty with a paintbrush is my passion.” Gould won the Award of Excellence from The Center for Contemporary Art in Bernardsville for his “Schiff Meadow #2” painting over the summer.  Gould invites you to attend his October 5th Gallery Exhibit to enjoy his vibrant surrealistic painting, blues music and delicious food. A portion of the proceeds will be donated to the Schiff. The Alhamra Gallery & Art Center is located at 21 Clairmont Rd, Bernardsville. Mendham Artist Will Exhibit Paintings at Alhamra Gallery & Art Center in Bernardsville on October 5 added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "By: Michele DiPasquale To some, a library may be a thing of the past; but in fact, libraries are currently visited much more frequently than one might think. And public libraries can still proclaim that they are not only crucial to the populace for offering the enjoyment of reading for free, but for the very relevant and contemporary services they provide. In fact, a recent survey showed that, since 2016, 53% of Millennials say they used a library at least twice in any given year, and that number is actually higher when comparing it to 45% of Gen Xers and 43% of Baby Boomers who were simultaneously polled. So even in today’s online world, the public library is still absolutely in demand. Catherine Tinger GoldbergThere are public libraries for children, adolescents, teens, and adults, but the very first library for your very young child, is, in fact, First Library® of Morristown. At First Library new mothers and parents can borrow books and other materials, make use of reference collections, enjoy computer services, and encourage early literacy and the joy of reading.  “The idea to start First Library® came to me after my friend, Diane, had her first child. I wanted to give my love of reading to her and her newborn, so I sent her some books to read to her baby son, Lubin. Diane later explained that she was having a hard time finding English-language children’s books to read to him and that my books were the perfect gift for a new first-time mother (from the United States living in France). So I began sending her a new children’s book every month – many were childhood favorites of my own children. Diane would call or write to say how she, and later her son, happily anticipated the arrival of their monthly book and the joy they received reading it together, and how they both looked forward to reading time,” shared Catherine Tinger Goldberg, founder and director of First Library®. She felt that if a book could bring so much happiness, joy, and comfort to just one child, how much could it bring to multiple children? It was then that she decided to create First Library®. By taking a cue from Dolly Parton and her Imagination Library program, Ms. Tinger Goldberg followed Ms. Parton’s idea. The Imagination Library was created in 1995 for in-need children in Ms. Parton’s native Tennessee. The purpose was and is for each child, regardless of gender, race, or income, to register at the Imagination Library program and receive a free book each month until the age of five, paid for by Ms. Parton’s Dollywood Foundation®. While it began for children in need in Tennessee, Ms. Parton, by the year 2000, allowed and promoted the replication of the program to other states.  In order to promote local library patronage, First Library® became more than a free monthly book program. Ms. Tinger Goldberg devised a curriculum for first-time mothers in need that was tailored to their and their firstborn child’s special circumstances. The curriculum would give first-time parents in need the First Library® book program (or other books) and gently-used clothing and educational toys during their child’s first three years of life, free of charge, by requiring parents to read to their child daily and submit a reading log each month.  First Library® was developed for first-time mothers and their child’s individual needs and wants. First Library offers the newborn children of first-time mothers, regardless of gender, race, or income, up to 60 free, brand new, age-appropriate books, until the child is the age of five, at no cost or financial obligation to their families. Books are mailed monthly to the child’s home. At First Library there’s also a story hour, craft time, educational presentations, summer reading programs, and family-oriented events are held frequently. The First Library® program offers first-time mothers, the majority in need, additional free books during their child’s first three years of life through various free reading-related activities (beyond the First Library’s program daily reading and monthly library visits) to shop quarterly for free gifts at the online book store, More First Library® Shop. “All we ask is that parents read to their child daily and maintain regular library patronage,” Ms. Tinger Goldberg explained.  “Essentially we are a free book program but sometimes more than a book a month is necessary to bring the importance of regular reading and books into a home. For children born under the poverty level there are new educational toys and clothing available for the parents,” Ms. Tinger Goldberg said. “I feel it is so important for children to be read to early and consistently. Children should have a firm foundation for a lifetime love of reading, respect for literature, and an appreciation for all things the library has to offer. I hope I am achieving these goals with First Library®,” Ms. Tinger Goldberg explained. Because First Library is in five counties and growing throughout the State of New Jersey, aside from receptions at their offices, they rely on individual community members and Community Actions teams to spread the word about First Library’s mission and fundraising efforts. They do accept monetary donations on behalf of the donor’s community through Classy.org. First Library is also an approved charity of the AmazonSmile program. “What parents and other community members are starting to realize is that if we help all children, whether they are less fortunate or not, learn to read early and on a consistent basis, we are helping everyone in their class, school, and community,” she shared. First Library is available in Livingston, Carteret, Edison, North Brunswick, Port Reading, Sewaren, Perrineville, Cedar Knolls, Chatham Borough, Chatham Township, Green Village, Morristown, New Vernon, Whippany, Somerset, and Basking Ridge.  First Library Will Help Build Libraries of Babies added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "By Dawn M Chiossi  Going on since February of this year, Hackettstown’s Heath Village inspires their staff with its English Language Program.   This program is a class format, an offshoot of the Adult English Language Tutoring Program sponsored by the Literacy New Jersey Sussex Branch. This program is for any adult in Sussex or Warren Counties, who would like to improve their facility with English– making them more comfortable speaking English.    It has been said that education is a great equalizer. It opens doors to everyone; it stirs curiosity, accesses information, and lets the mind ponder, inquire and enjoy.   The English Language Program is spearheaded and run by two-year Heath Village resident, Marguerite Gadel, as well as Susan Sumner. Gadel explains that the program works with the State and Local Literacy New Jersey Organization’s Sussex Branch (a branch that expands to Warren County.)  Gadel herself had been a part of the literacy organization for an impressive 20 years.   Although relatively new, Heath Village’s program is an informal, inclusive one. It focuses mainly on spoken communication, conversational English, and some grammar and spelling.  Concentrating on how to be comfortable speaking English, students will learn enough to communicate easily in functional areas such as making appointments or filling out forms. The program seeks to make communications easier and much more fluid, both in work and social situations.   Additionally, the class will make it more enjoyable for students to follow a TV program or read a book. “I want them to really enjoy reading in English,” Gadel shares.   “There’s even some students in the class who are taking their test for citizenship. That’s a big job,” she prides.  Gadel explains that she came up with the idea of starting the program soon after she moved to Heath Village.   Immediately proposing the idea to Heath Village’s CEO to make the program available, and receiving an overwhelmingly positive response, she set to work.   Wanting the English Language Program to be engaging and relatable for the students, the program involves them right away by having them read out loud. “We try to jump on something of interest to the students or go over something from the week before that they had learned,” Gadel explains.    For these students, learning English is not a chore, but a pleasure.  Gadel can’t say enough about her students in general, admiring their determination and hard work ethic. “They come to class completely on their own time. Usually after working a full day. Then they’ll have to go home, take care of their families and do homework. It’s so impressive that they are willing to put in the time and effort to do this,” she enthuses.  They will even find creative ways to learn. For example, Gadel relates that one of her students will watch the news without subtitles to learn what is going on.  For Gadel, just the small act of using her talents to make a difference in the lives of others has created a ripple effect. “I love seeing the students help each other,” she says. “For instance, a student from Mexico will help someone from Colombia. It is wonderful to see that happen. It is thrilling to see them put in so much effort and work so hard to learn.”  Gadel sees with her own eyes how much of an impact the program is making to her students. They are not only learning but enjoying. What’s more, they are sharing that feeling and connection with others.  “I remember when the class discovered that Heath Village had a new resident, a lady from England who had been in England’s Royal Air Force (R.A.F.) in World War II,” Gadel shares. “A student had recently read an article to us regarding the R.A.F. Because of that, the class eagerly wanted to talk to this lady and ask her questions. They were so involved, asking about her experiences and how they were different in England as opposed to here in America. It was wonderful.”  The Literacy New Jersey Sussex Branch will be training new volunteers to be tutors beginning in late September.  Training for new tutors is offered in the spring and the fall. It is ideal for someone who would like to make a difference, no experience is necessary.  Training consists of three in-person meetings interspersed with online training. The first session is especially useful in helping people decide whether or not they would like to do the tutoring. “I would love to encourage some people to train for this great volunteer work. We always have waiting students,” Gadel enthuses. For further information or details on tutoring, please contact Literacy New Jersey Sussex County Office at 973-300-9444 or by visiting www.literacynj.orgHackettstown’s Heath Village Inspires Staff with English Language Program added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "How To Combat Cold And Flu(NAPSI)—According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), chances are good you’ll get a cold or the flu this year. Adults have an average of two to three colds per year and children have even more, while 5 to 20 percent of the population gets the flu. Fortunately, there are steps you can take to minimize your risk and ease your symptoms.Consider these tips from Chloraseptic® pharmacist spokesperson Maria Mantione:• Get a flu shot. The CDC recommends a flu shot for everyone over the age of 6 months. It’s easy to get—just talk to your pharmacist. It’s the best way to prevent the spread of the flu. It does not prevent the common cold, but the flu is a devastating, serious illness that could put you out of commission for a week or more or, even worse, land you in the hospital with pneumonia or infect someone you love with a weaker immune system—such as babies, the elderly or those undergoing chemotherapy.• Wash your hands often. Washing your hands with soap and water is the best way to prevent the spread of the common cold.• Prevent illness by practicing healthy habits. Make sure to get enough sleep, eat a balanced, nutritious diet, exercise and minimize stress.• If you do get sick, talk to your pharmacist about how to manage your symptoms with medications. Before cold season, stock your medicine cabinet with the essentials. Stick to single-ingredient products, so you have what you need to treat your specific symptoms. These include pain relievers and fever reducers, a decongestant, cough medicine, lozenges and a sore throat spray. Topical medications, such as Chloraseptic sore throat sprays and lozenges, are great to have on hand because they’re portable, can be used safely with other cold medicines and have very few side effects.In fact, Chloraseptic is the No. 1 sore throat relief brand around. It provides fast-acting relief for sore throats and mouth pain to help you get through your day.From lozenges that soothe nasal passages and suppress coughs to sprays that target pain when and where it hurts, there’s a broad portfolio of products based on your preferences and needs.The lozenges have a soothing liquid center that relieves pain and cools nasal passages. MAX Wild Berry is the strongest throat relief lozenge in the line. Chloraseptic Total offers a multisymptom lozenge formula that can suppress your cough for up to four hours.Chloraseptic’s sprays are the No. 1 pharmacist-recommended brand. The new and improved Cherry Spray tastes great, works on contact and is free of aspirin, sugar and gluten. The MAX Wild Berry Targeted Throat Spray is convenient for travel or to keep in your purse. The targeted spray makes it easier when you’re on the go to coat and protect specific areas in your mouth and throat. All these products are available at mass retailers, major drugstores and grocery stores.Also helping to keep you ahead of the flu this season is an online Cold + Flu tracker. To check for outbreaks and symptoms, go to www.chloraseptic.com, click on Cold + Flu Tracker and enter your zip code.How To Combat Cold And Flu added by new_view_media on December 22, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Helping Older People to Maintain Independence(NAPSI)—For most older adults, the ability to live independently is associated with the ability to drive. That’s one reason the prospect of eventually “giving up the keys” can be a frightening one.To help, the experts on aging at the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging (n4a) developed a brochure called “Before You Give Up the Keys: Create a Roadmap for Transportation Independence” that may lessen those fears by empowering older adults to evaluate their mobility needs, identify the transportation options in their community and develop a plan customized to their unique circumstances.“A too-familiar scenario is that older adults wait until they’re involved in some sort of emergency, like a traffic accident, before they really think about their driving ability and the other transportation options available to them in their community,” said n4a CEO Sandy Markwood. “Our goal is to shed light on a critical issue that will likely affect most families with an older loved one who may need to limit or eliminate their driving, and to provide a catalyst for discussion, and hopefully, action,” Markwood also noted.The n4a represents America’s national network of 623 Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs). It helps older adults and people with disabilities live with dignity and choices in their homes and communities for as long as possible.To that end, it created the Eldercare Locator. This serves as an essential, trusted gateway to help older adults, caregivers and health professionals navigate the maze of aging programs and services, as well as to assist them in identifying and accessing the resources that match their needs best. The National Call Center operates five days a week from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET and can be reached at 800-677-1116 or www.eldercare.gov.According to recent research by the Federal Transit Administration, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, n4a and the National Aging and Disability Transportation Center, the rise in the 65-plus population—some 45 million and growing—has triggered a corresponding spike in the number of nondrivers of more than 1.1 million between 2001 and 2009.“This is a major issue for older adults because when they lack access to transportation, they can’t get to the doctor, the grocery store or see friends and family as much, which means their overall well-being is likely to suffer,” added Kathy Greenlee, Assistant Secretary for Aging.Free BrochureTo download the free brochure, go to www.n4a.org/files/ResourcesforOlderAdults.pdf.

The mouth is a major doorway for all sorts of microorganisms, which can be linked to anything from the common cold to heart disease and diabetes. Hence, the importance of having a healthy mouth cannot be overstated.”“More than 300 kinds of microorganisms thrive in the human mouth,” explains Astrid Shroetter, D.D.S. “What’s more, the typical toothbrush is reused for months and never cleaned thoroughly.”Research indicates that kids get sick on average about 10 times a year—that’s almost once a month. While dentists and parents both encourage good oral hygiene, it would be nice to do so without worrying about potential reinfection caused by brushing teeth with contaminated toothbrushes. As Dr. Gilbert-Fowler puts it, “You wouldn’t clean your house with a dirty washcloth. Why clean your teeth with a dirty toothbrush?”A Solution“It’s important to keep toothbrushes in a clean environment and separate from other toothbrushes,” recommends Gilbert-Fowler. “Use of a Steripod® clip-on toothbrush protector will help keep your toothbrush clean and protect against outside contaminants and cross contamination from other toothbrushes. It’s important for kids and adults alike to replace toothbrushes every three months or more frequently after any illness.”Developed by doctors and independently tested for efficacy at an accredited lab, Steripod is a clip-on protector that fits any standard or electric toothbrush. Using a patented natural vapor shield of thymol, derived from the thyme plant, Steripod keeps toothbrushes fresh and clean for up to three months. Simply clip it on your electric or manual toothbrush and it goes to work; no cables or batteries are needed. You can use it at home, work, the gym, school or when you travel.More Pearls of Wisdom for Your Pearly Whites:To further put the bite on dental disease, heed these five tips from the experts at the American Dental Association:1. Brush your teeth twice a day for two minutes with a soft-bristled brush.2. Replace your toothbrush every three or four months, or if the bristles are frayed.3. Use an ADA-accepted fluoride toothpaste.4. Clean between teeth daily with floss.5. Visit your dentist regularly for professional cleanings and oral exams.Learn MoreVisit www.GetSteripod.com or call (310) 204-7880.Protect Your Health, Protect Your Toothbrush added by new_view_media on December 22, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "6 Tips for Planning Your Wedding Photos Like a Pro\n",
      "Five words or less(NewsUSA) – With everything that goes into your wedding day, those once-in-a-lifetime moments will go by in a blur, which is why hiring a professional wedding photographer is a must. After all, the last thing you should be worrying about is whether your photographer will be able to capture your big day.\n",
      "The key? Prepare yourself so that you can accurately evaluate the “right” photographer for you.\n",
      "“The best photographer will take the time to build a rapport with you and use his or her experience and creativity to capture the mood, personality, ambiance and even the geography of your wedding,” says PPA (Professional Photographers of America) photographer Berit Bizjak. “The finest wedding photography is more than a series of still pictures. It’s physical poetry — it tells the story of the day and portrays the essence of both people and place.”\n",
      "To this end, PPA, the largest international nonprofit association created by professional photographers, has taken the guesswork out of the process by offering six tips to help you plan your wedding photos like a pro:\n",
      "1. Book far in advance. The best photographers get booked quickly — sometimes as much as a year in advance — so don’t wait until the last minute to book your photographer.\n",
      "2. Show them the money. Now is not the time to skimp on your photo budget. Call around and get a price range for services, and remember: after the cake is long gone, and the dress is stored away, your wedding photos will be the only things left to share and enjoy for years to come, so don’t cut too many corners on your photography budget — you’ll end up regretting it.\n",
      "3. Make sure your photographer is a real pro. Only hire someone who has liability insurance, experience taking the style of photos you want, backup equipment and a plan for when things go south. Ideally, he or she is a PPA photographer. PPA photographers do more than just snap pictures. They have the technical expertise and artistry to make you look your best and bring your vision to life. They also abide by a strict code of ethics that makes a real difference. Watch this (video) to see real married couples share their stories.\n",
      "4. Request to see a full gallery of real weddings. Look at full wedding coverage (not just a small selection of each wedding’s best moments) to see a photographer’s true style and get a sense of how he or she might tell your “story.” Do you prefer more artistic or traditional poses? Would you rather have a photojournalist approach or a mix of all styles?\n",
      "5.Work with your photographer to create a detailed shot list. PPA wedding photographers can also help you create that shot list, as they know what key moments tell a wedding story and can prepare for those. But talk about your must-haves, and walk through the entire program with your photographer ahead of time. Share your expectations ahead of time to ensure that he or she captures the key shots, while remaining attentive and available to catch the best candid moments.\n",
      "6. Plan your post-wedding photo strategy• ahead of time! Almost as soon as the festivities are over, you’ll be eager to look at the photos so you can relive your big day over and over again. Ask your photographer for teasers or a “sneak peek” and a timeline for when the rest of the pictures will be available. Will they give you an online gallery for family and friends to choose the images they want? Again, knowing these things ahead of time will make things easy on the back end, sparing you any heartache.6 Tips for Planning Your Wedding Photos Like a Pro added by new_view_media on December 22, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Wedding Gifts for Grooms: A Tradition Brides Shouldn’t Ignore\n",
      "Five words or less(NewsUSA) – The answer is: Yes, it’s expected.\n",
      "But it’s also a chance for all you brides out there to truly show you know that not everything is about you on your wedding day. That there really is another person involved (that would be the groom) who deserves a bit of recognition, too.\n",
      "We’re talking wedding presents — specifically, yours to your husband-to-be.\n",
      "Tradition does, indeed, hold that both you and he exchange gifts. And while it’s true that some guys are initially shocked to learn your engagement ring doesn’t also count as a “present,” that’s no excuse for you to waver.\n",
      "“Giving him something that’s just for him will make him feel really special,” advises BrideBox.com.\n",
      "Here’s what you need to know now that it’s prime time for weddings:\n",
      "* When to exchange them. Etiquette dictates that the hand-off occurs at one of three times: the night before the wedding, the morning of the ceremony, or right before leaving on your honeymoon. Think it’s bad luck to see the groom before the nuptials? “Many couples choose to courier gifts via bridesmaids or groomsmen just before the ceremony,” says Brides.com.\n",
      "* There’s a thin line between “romantic” and “mushy.” Some of you may be tempted to compile a “love notes” journal of every bit of correspondence you’ve ever sent your groom. Even assuming he’s the type who wouldn’t consider that a bit “over the top,” there’s always the chance he might be left wondering, “Okay, where’s my real present?”– especially if his gift to you is a serious piece of jewelry.\n",
      "* The consensus choice. There’s a reason a watch invariably makes everyone’s short list: It’s the perfect statement of who he is or aspires to be. (It’s also a lot more impressive than a flask, which for some reason also gets a few votes).\n",
      "No less a taste arbiter than MarthaStewartWeddings.com favors Baume & Mercier’s Clifton line — as elegant as the original 1950s model that inspired it — for the way it “easily transitions from big day to every day.” Like the Swiss watchmaker’s timelessly charming (and affordably luxurious) Classima line, it comes with a choice of straps, dial faces and a variety of what’s known as “small complications” that go way beyong just telling the hour. You can shop them at the Baume & Mercier e-boutique or by calling 1-800-MERCIER, where free engraving and wrapping are available.\n",
      "* Fun fact. One writer at AskMen.com says he’s “heard of women giving their husbands watches in the ceremony instead of a wedding ring.” If so, the answer is: No, just like your engagement ring, that wouldn’t also qualify as a wedding present.Wedding Gifts for Grooms: A Tradition Brides Shouldn’t Ignore added by new_view_media on December 22, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Want to Increase Revenue? Take Your Business Global(NAPSI)—International selling may seem daunting, but thanks to the Internet, it’s more attainable than ever. With the right tools in place, small businesses can go global and increase revenues without the headache.The question then is, “Where should I sell?” Consider these two destinations as you map out your plan for international growth:CanadaCanadians are e-commerce enthusiasts—in fact, 60 percent of Canada’s online shoppers buy from U.S.-based sellers. As an added bonus, there’s typically no language barrier for U.S. businesses selling into Canada.Given this opportunity for U.S. small businesses, the U.S. Postal Service opted to create zone-based pricing for all Priority Mail International® shipments headed to Canada starting on May 31, 2015.This means that the USPS will charge for shipping based on the U.S. origin ZIP code and the Canada destination postal code, instead of blending expensive routes into one flat rate.There will now be seven pricing zones for shipping. Some rates will increase, but for businesses in major cities—such as San Francisco, Miami and Chicago—savings will be around $8 per package.BrazilLatin America is the world’s second-fastest-growing e-commerce market, and leading this boom is Brazil. With 202 million citizens, of whom 33.5 million shop online, Brazil presents a huge opportunity for U.S.-based businesses looking to expand, though it’s not without its challenges.Due to delays in customs clearance, postal packages could take up to 20 days to arrive. Duties and taxes, as well as complicated custom forms, slow the process for both U.S. merchants and the buyers.However, there are solutions. Shipping technology company Endicia just launched a program called Endicia Global Service, which allows shipments from U.S. businesses to reach Brazilian customers in as little as 8 days. Additionally, duties and taxes can be paid by the buyer up front, and there are no complicated customs forms to fill out.“International selling is a great way to grow a business and secure additional revenue,” said Endicia co-founder and general manager Amine Khechfé. “These markets in particular are undergoing massive growth, and there’s never been a better time for small businesses to look into them.”To learn about the tools you need to succeed in going global, check out www.endicia.com/go-global.Want to Increase Revenue?

      "(BPT) – Remember free time? You used to have so much of it. But these days, work and family obligations have you running around constantly and you don’t know what to do first. You don’t even have time to do everything you have to do, let alone what you want to do.So how do you take back your day? How do you find the time to get things done and bring back some semblance of order? It is possible if you focus on making yourself more efficient. To help you accomplish all of your goals and find some free time as well, here are four ways you can improve your efficiency every single day.* Make a plan. When you’re running through your list of daily obligations the morning of, it’s easy to forget a thing or two, especially if you have children running around, phones ringing or dogs barking to distract you. Instead, plan out the upcoming day the night before. Make a list of everything you have to do and check these items against one another. Can two trips be combined? Are you prioritizing the most important things first? The better you can plan out your schedule, the more organized you’ll be the next day.* Get the news and information you need ASAP. You are bombarded by digital content every day and some of it is really important – but who has time to sift through it all? To help you find the information you need as quickly as possible, Fresly LLC launched a new app, iNews Photo. Whether you are on the go, or gathering news in your office this application allows you access to global and local news curated in real time by former journalist directly to your mobile phone or on a larger screen.* Set priorities. You don’t have time to do it all and maybe you don’t have to. Sit down and make a list of every social or professional group and obligation you belong to. Once you’ve made the list, look at it and ask yourself honestly how important this obligation is to you or your family. If you find the obligation is not essential, you’re better off to abandon it and save your time for the responsibilities that are more important to you.* Limit multitasking. Many people look to multitasking as an efficiency solution, but doing several things at once means it takes longer to accomplish any one task. And when the first task is completed, the result is often poorer because of it. Instead of trying to do several things at once, focus on the most important thing, accomplish it and move on.With today’s hectic schedules, finding the opportunity to do everything you’re supposed to do may seem impossible. However, if you apply the four tips listed above, you’ll improve your efficiency, stay up on the latest news and maybe even discover that elusive free time you sorely deserve.

      "medical workers working together in hospital(BPT) – Over the last decade, a number of changes have transformed the healthcare industry. The Affordable Care Act has enabled more than 16.4 million Americans to receive healthcare coverage. Advancements in technology improve both diagnoses and treatment quality. Retail health offers a convenience used by more than 10 million patients at 1,800 retail health locations. Along with the current challenges facing the healthcare system, such as an aging population, increased patient volume and physician shortages, these changes prompt the expansion of the traditional role of a nurse.Generally, Americans believe nurses’ roles are expanding as they share increased responsibilities to support the delivery of high quality healthcare, according to a poll commissioned by University of Phoenix College of Health Professions. The survey also found that adults in the United States view their experience with nurses as overwhelmingly positive. In fact, 95 percent found nurses to be a valuable addition to the healthcare system as a whole, and 87 percent view nurses as trusted sources of health information.“As nurses take on greater responsibility, and as the needs of healthcare organizations continue to grow more complex, the skills and training requirements of nurses must be prepared to match this growth,” says Betty Nelson, Ph.D., RN, and academic dean for University of Phoenix School of Nursing. “This is especially important given that the United States is currently facing a shortage of as many as 90,000 physicians by 2025.. Nurses with advanced education can help fill this shortage, particularly in areas where consumers do not have access to care.”Because of this, employers are looking for nurses with a variety of skills and certifications including:* Additional degrees or seeking an advanced degree* In-demand skills such as bilingualism, leadership and critical thinking* Flexibility and professionalism* The desire to grow into advanced practitioners such as nurse practitioners and physician assistants* Specialized training for working with various populations* An openness to diverse opportunities in a number of different facilitiesIn order to keep up with the changes in the healthcare system, at least 80 percent of the nation’s nursing workforce will need a bachelor’s degree by 2020 and the number of nurses with doctoral degrees will need to be double, according to the Institute of Medicine. Nursing education institutions play a critical role in meeting the needs of today’s healthcare system. Nurses need a place to obtain these degrees and further their skills within the healthcare industry. Institutions recognize the expanding role of the 21st century nurse and are offering a wide range of curriculum and degree programs that address recent changes in the delivery of primary care. Graduates need to be equipped with the skills they need to succeed in today’s health care market.It’s now more important than ever that nurses have the training and skills to match the demands of the growing profession. Along with the nursing community, institutions that offer nursing degree programs must work together to enhance and better prepare the nursing workforce.What employers look for in the 21st century nurse added by new_view_media on November 15, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "(BPT) – What image does the word “grilling” bring to mind? Do you envision thick, juicy burgers or steaks? What about sauce-slathered chicken breasts sizzling over coals? Cooking out is one of the great joys of warm weather, but if you leave side dishes out of your grilling plans – or stick with cold sides like salads – you’re missing out on some great flavors.Side dishes give you a chance to really show off your grilling chops, savor the farm fresh flavors of summer harvests, and indulge in wholesome, organic fare. Here are six summer side dishes that go great on the grill:1. Corn on the cob – If you’ve always wanted to try grilling vegetables but weren’t sure which of your favorites would go well on the grill – take heart! Virtually any veggie can be prepared on a grill, but corn becomes a show-stopper when grilled. Remove the husks and silk and toss the cobs right on a preheated grill. Watch them careful and keep turning them to ensure they brown but don’t burn. The heat from the grill causes the natural sugars in the corn to carmelize, and you’ll end up with the sweetest sweet corn you ever tasted!2. Fries – A trip to the grocery store or farmer’s market for fresh produce may not fit in your schedule if you’re grilling on the fly. There’s good news – frozen options like Alexia Organic Oven Crinkles with Sea Saltdeliver farm to flavor taste when prepared on the grill or in the oven. Made from Pacific Northwest russet potatoes, Alexia’s organic fries are sprinkled with bright sea salt to bring out even more of the rich flavor that Mother Nature delivered. Make a tray out of aluminum foil, spread the Oven Crinkles in a single layer, and grill for about 20-25 minutes at 400-450 degrees F. Turn once or twice during the cooking process.3. Tomatoes – If you’ve only grilled small tomatoes on a kabob, or never tried grilled tomatoes at all, this is your summer to discover grilling tomatoes couldn’t be easier. Start with large, meaty tomatoes – a variety that’s dense and has fewer seeds works best. Slice in half, brush with your favorite seasoned oil and place the halves cut-side down on the grill. Cook for 3-5 minutes on each side. Top with your favorite cheese when done.4. Kale – Grilling greens like kale helps all those wonderful nutrients and flavor stay in the vegetable and don’t disappear into the cooking water – which is what can happen when you boil veggies on the stovetop. Grilling kale couldn’t be easier. You can adapt virtually any of your favorite kale recipes to grilling by tossing the kale with the recipe seasonings and some oil. Arrange the seasoned leaves in a single layer on the grill and they’ll cook to crispy splendor in just minutes.5. Cheese – A slice of gooey melted cheese is the crowning glory atop your grilled burger, but cheese can also handle the grill on its own, and be a delicious, different side dish or appetizer. Many cheeses will work on the grill, and you can find recommendations for the best cheeses to cook on the grill with a simple online search. Slice your chosen cheese in thick pieces. Most grilling cheeses will need minimal seasoning and little or no oil. Generally, cheese takes just a minute or two to brown each side and allow the inside to melt.6. Dinner rolls – Craving dinner rolls to go with that thick juicy steak, but in no mood to fire up the oven when it’s 90 degrees outside? You can make frozen dinner rolls on the grill. Choose your favorite variety, such as Alexia Artisan French Rolls or Artisan Focaccia Rolls, set your gas grill to the temperature recommended on the package’s directions, wrap the rolls in foil and place directly on the grill. Keep an eye on the rolls to ensure they don’t burn as they can cook quickly on a grill.6 summer sides you never knew you could grill added by new_view_media on April 3, 2016View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "(BPT) – Traditional wedding rules have fallen by the wayside – food trucks are in, having a hashtag is a must, bridesmaids no longer wear the same dress and groomsmen are sometimes in sneakers. Couples are actively seeking ways to differentiate themselves and get creative. All that aside, there is one thing that remains constant – weddings must have wine.Without wine, there is no glass to raise during the toast to the bride and groom and nothing to drink when the bar closes during dinner. Wine is the first thing guests are offered when they take a seat, and – you know that they say – it’s important to make a good first impression.Choosing the right varietals for your wedding does not have to be a stressful endeavor. Whether you’re a novice wine drinker or a connoisseur, follow these four tips and you’ll please a crowd without spending a fortune:Say “cheers!” with a sparkling wine.People love a good toast, and nothing washes down a teary maid of honor speech like a glass of sparkling. Riondo Prosecco is an accessible option that’s ideal to enjoy any day of the year, but perfectly suited for special occasions. You’ll get six pours out of a bottle, so plan accordingly!Good things come in threes.In addition to a sparkling, you’ll want a red and a white option that are familiar and food-friendly. You can’t go wrong with a Merlot – look for labels from the Napa region. For a white, Terlato Friuli Pinot Grigio is exceptional and ideal for food pairing.Wine math: What you didn’t learn in school.Running out of wine mid-wedding isn’t an option, so it’s important to do the math. You should anticipate getting about 5 glasses per bottle and assume that each guest will drink one glass per hour. Follow this rule and the wine will flow all night long, keeping you and your guests happy.Don’t break the bank, but stay away from the cheap stuff.Choosing an excellent wine doesn’t mean paying top-dollar, but buying too cheap can mean sacrificing quality. There are countless high-quality, delicious, wines available for $10-$20 per bottle, so leave the cheap stuff on the bottom shelf!4 wine buying tips for weddings added by new_view_media on April 3, 2016View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "(BPT) – Around-the-clock food shows, celebrity guests and niche themed restaurants are just a few reasons the fine food movement continues to experience extraordinary growth. In 2016, more people will be seeking upscale dining experiences that focus on the unique to the luxurious — and they’re willing to pay big bucks to do so.In fact, Americans said they would splurge an average of $203 in order to have a once-in-a-lifetime dining experience at a gourmet restaurant, according to a recent online survey by Harris Poll sponsored byMichelin, the global tire maker that publishes the popular restaurant guide.What’s surprising is the people willing to pay the most for fine dining experiences are younger generations. Millennials (ages 18-34) on average would pay $282 for this culinary experience, compared to diners ages 45-54 who would shell out $170, and $122 for those 65 and older.One explanation for why younger diners are willing to pay so much is that they want to enjoy more than just fine cuisine. Many restaurants offer an overall experience that will be remembered long after the last morsel of food is gone. Whether it’s an incredible atmosphere, the opportunity to observe the chef work or gaining access to foods and cooking styles never available before, this desire for an experience is driving younger diners to invest in upscale dining.As America looks at the most recent Michelin star ratings to navigate the nation’s best eateries, there are some food and restaurant trends that are positioned to grow in 2016. Chefs will continue to expand their creative prowess by experimenting with new cooking styles and food fusions. Cooking methods will blend with science and art to create uniquely fine fare with a story that is as intriguing as the taste.Diversity is another notable trend for 2016. Authentic ethnic cuisine is in high demand and restaurants are answering the call. Traditional restaurants will begin to offer diverse plates in addition to timeless favorites to appeal to a wide range of palates. Expect to see more ancient grains, ethnic spices and worldly condiments at eateries in the future.Conscious dining is a growing trend thanks to diners’ increasing awareness of where their food comes from. Hyper-local sourcing of ingredients is being adopted by many notable restaurants. This includes growing fresh herbs and vegetables onsite and partnering with local farms for incredibly fresh dairy and meat products. Sustainable seafood partnerships are another effort by restaurants that supports the increasing demand for responsible dining options.Finally, diners are seeking chefs with the best reputation for tried-and-true favorites. That means the city’s chef with a reputation for curating and cooking the best steak will have a wait list. Supporting this nod toward the traditional, the Michelin survey found a quarter of U.S. adults say steakhouse cuisine is their favorite choice for dining. What’s the runner up? Italian ranked as the second choice nationally for the meal of a lifetime.Which 2016 dining trend do you want to try most? added by new_view_media on April 3, 2016View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "(BPT) – Snacks, produce, drinks or sweets – if it is a seasonal offering, Americans are anxiously awaiting it. According to Nielsen, Americans spend about $374 billion annually on snack foods. For many of those snack lovers, items that are only available for a limited time are one of the major highlights of seasonal occasions and holidays, especially this time of year when, according to a recent Cheetos brand survey, 65 percent of Americans profess their love of seasonal Easter treats.Whether your favorite holiday arrives in spring, summer, winter or fall, seasonal treats can sweeten your enjoyment of the season. No one wants to miss the coveted special flavors and offerings that appear on store shelves for short stints and are quickly cleared out by that clever “seasonal snack stockpiler” who is always one step ahead of you. So here’s your guide to the top treats to watch for this spring, and throughout the year.SpringIt might still be too chilly to feel like spring in some areas of the country, but St. Patrick’s Day undoubtedly marks the start of the springtime snacking season. Milkshake lovers will kick things off with mint-green milkshakes, and quickly turn their attention to Easter candies and snacks.Chocolate and marshmallow sweets are the traditional stars of Easter baskets across the country – for both the young, and the young at heart. It is no surprise that 71 percent of parents who celebrate Easter admit to sneaking snacks from their kids’ baskets, according to the Cheetos survey.Of course, everyone is familiar with jelly beans, peanut butter eggs, chocolate bunnies and marshmallow chicks, but the majority of consumers say they desire more variety beyond just candy. This year, there’s a new must-try alternative to satisfy the search for something beyond the candy animal monotony. Cheetos Sweetos, the cinnamon-sugar version of everyone’s favorite cheddar cheese snacks is reappearing in stores — and Easter baskets — this spring, but only for a limited time. Launched in 2015, Sweetos snacks are the perfect, and delicious, twist on Easter snacking.SummerFrozen treats are the highlight of summer, but not just the ice cream quarts you find year-round in the freezer cases at your local grocer. Summer means the ice cream truck will be rolling through neighborhood streets, sounding that familiar melodic “come and get it” tune and serving up frozen favorites that you just can’t find anywhere else —  or at any other time of year.You can’t go wrong with the missile-shaped, multi-colored ice pops that beckon from beside a myriad of fruit-flavored cream pops, or reliable favorites like ice cream sandwiches and chocolate-topped cones. And don’t forget snow cones — the refreshing shaved ice in perfect spheres mounted on a paper funnel and topped with your favorite sweet flavoring!FallOf course everyone knows fall is pumpkin season — and you should take every chance to enjoy all things pumpkin-flavored this time of year, from coffee and ice cream to bread, cake and pie.However, autumn also heralds state fair season across the country — and the arrival of a variety of innovative sweet treats that can only be enjoyed among the unique surroundings of fair rides, tickets and games. Funnel cakes are a state fair staple, and what could be better when the weather gets nippy than enjoying lightly sweetened, deep-fried dough dusted heavily with confectioner’s sugar? Depending on where you live in the country and which fair you attend, you can find over-the-top sweets and snacks such as deep-fried ice cream, fried candy bars and even pretzel-encrusted brownies deep-fried on a stick.WinterOf course, winter holidays are the pinnacle of seasonal snacking. From the final weeks of pumpkin season to the eggnog, candy canes and baked goods associated with holiday moments from Thanksgiving through New Year’s, winter serves up a buffet of food and snacks that are available at no other time of year.Winter’s arrival means anticipated delicacies like gingerbread-flavored everything, bite-sized candy favorites that marry mint and chocolate in holiday shapes, and of course the much-maligned and equally beloved fruit cake all hit store shelves just in time to make the holiday party circuit!Whatever your preference — savory, salty or sweet — make sure to enjoy these snacking staples throughout the year. But remember that seasonal treats come and go quickly, so be ready to grab a bag of Sweetos snacks, remember to listen for the ice cream truck’s playful tune, try your state’s delicacies and fill stockings with enough gingerbread cookies or mint-themed chocolate drops to last through the end of the year!Don’t miss these must-have snacks that define each season of the year added by new_view_media on April 3, 2016View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Be Well Tressed Every Day With Wigs(NAPSI)—Changing your hair to suit your hat, your mood or your outfit-or to make holidays and other celebrations that much more special—can be easier and more fun than ever.TV Star’s IdeaExplains Daytime Emmy Award winner Sherri Shepherd, “When I was a little girl, I would hear all this commotion in my house from my mom, aunts and grandmother when picking out their wigs for the day. It was such a good time for them and was a major part of their everyday beauty routines. Ever since then, I’ve watched the women in my household glow with confidence because they would customize their look day by day through the use of faux hair. My grandmother had a wig that she would pick out and wear perfectly with specific hats. My mother had an Angela Davis ‘power to the people’ wig. Watching these iconic women in my life pair their hair lengths, styles and colors with particular hats, outfits and personalities was exciting. Getting ready to go out was like an event in and of itself. Wigs are the perfect way for the inner diva in all women to come out and get creative, which is why I was inspired to start my own wig line to give women the choices to create their own style and look.“I always say, you were born with the hair you’ve got—now get the hair you want. Short and sassy, long and sexy or curly and fierce; you can easily change your hairstyle and transform your whole look to fit whatever your day brings. This is one of the reasons I wanted to create my line of wigs for Luxhair—I wanted to be able to give busy women high-quality, versatile looks to choose from that were simple and quick to put on but that were affordable and wouldn’t break their budget too.”The result is the Luxhair Now by Sherri Shepherd high-fashion wig and extension collection. “The collection provides the look you want, the style you want and the perfect accent to make a personal style statement, now.”Why WigsLike putting on your most stylish shoes and more powerful than a red lipstick, Shepherd says, these high-fashion styles can add some fabulous to your everyday. They can also be an excellent accessory to have during the holiday season when you want a party perfect ‘do but don’t want to spend a lot of time getting it. With a variety of lace front styles that give the appearance of natural hair growth, allow for styling away from the face and heat-friendly fiber, these wigs stand up to heat and humidity, offer styling options, and look, feel and move like real hair.What’s NewNow that Luxhair Now by Sherri Shepherd has partnered with national retailer Sally Beauty Supply, two new fun wig styles are available in over 1,900 stores nationwide.• Textured Pixie is a sassy pixie wig that features choppy texture for maximum volume and style along with precision-cut bangs that frame the face. It comes in medium dark brown, medium and light auburn and golden brown with auburn highlights.• The Feathered Pixie is a short, side-swept pixie with feathered texture and volume.

      "On National Senior Citizens Day, Three Ways To Celebrate The Older Generation(NAPSI)—Whether it’s your parents, grandparents, aunt, uncle or neighbor, you likely received guidance from or looked to older people in your life as you’ve tried to become more independent and deal with change and everyday challenges. August 21 is National Senior Citizens Day, and it’s an ideal time to honor seniors for the wisdom and care they have provided us, and also to celebrate the members of the older generation by finding ways to enhance their lives as they age.There’s No Place Like HomeNearly 90 percent of seniors want to age in place—stay in their own homes as they get older. But one out of three seniors suffers a fall each year, according to the CDC. Making an older person’s home as safe as possible is integral to helping him or her maintain this independence. Walking through seniors’ daily routine with them, from the time they get out of bed to when they go back to sleep, can reveal patterns in how they navigate their home and any potential hazards. By identifying the areas of concern and making necessary adjustments, you can decrease the risk of an accident and seniors can reside more confidently in their own home.Stay ConnectedTechnology now allows grandparents to FaceTime their children and grandchildren across the globe or even in the next town, and seniors to reconnect with classmates of decades past via Facebook. Older generations can create, build and maintain quality social relationships with the convenience and ease of social media. Seniors have a multitude of online outlets to share updates, photos and videos with loved ones. To help them stay in touch, ensure that the seniors in your life have reliable Internet connectivity, and help them set up social media accounts if they don’t have one already. In-person interaction is ideal, but keeping in touch through computers, tablets and smartphones is a great way to supplement seeing and speaking with each other.Everyone’s Wearing TechnologyWearable technology like the Apple Watch is popular among younger audiences, but wearable fitness trackers and medical alert devices can provide great benefits to seniors as well. In the event of a fall or accident where it’s impossible to get to a phone to call for help, a medical alert device immediately connects the injured to emergency services. Because that person’s medical history and health needs are on file, first responders can more easily treat them. With help a push of a button away, medical alert devices give seniors peace of mind even beyond health concerns. In fact, a recent survey by Bay Alarm Medical found that 80 percent of medical alert device wearers worry less when their adult children travel because they feel the device provides an adequate support system. If you decide to help protect the senior in your life with a wearable medical alert system, it’s also wise to look for a caring, people-first, ethical provider. Bay Alarm Medical, for example, implemented a Code of Ethics it follows for uncompromisingly ethical and transparent business practices. The company vows to prioritize customers over sales, make pricing publicly accessible and never pressure customers into a product or service they do not need, among other safeguards.National Senior Citizens Day is a day to commemorate the great ways in which seniors have helped us and we should show them how thankful we are every day. Simple steps such as a home safety walk-through, staying connected and providing the tools to enhance their physical and emotional well-being can go a long way in reducing the stress of aging for seniors and their loved ones.On National Senior Citizens Day, Three Ways To Celebrate The Older Generation added by new_view_media on December 24, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Don’t Let The Flu Mean Missing Memorable Moments(NAPSI)—While the cold and flu season often coincides with holiday celebrations and family get-togethers, there are preventative measures that families can take to stay healthy and not miss out.To help you get to the next “can’t miss” life event, consider these top preventative tips:• Get an annual flu shot. It’s the most effective way to help prevent the spread of influenza. For your convenience, you can get a vaccine at any of the more than 7,800 CVS/pharmacy and 900 MinuteClinic locations across the country. The flu shot is available every day with no appointment needed, including evenings and weekends.As a preventive service under the Affordable Care Act, it’s fully covered and available at no cost through most insurance plans, including Medicare Part B.The pharmacy can also be a one-stop shop for flu prevention resources, including over-the-counter cold and flu remedies, multivitamins and anti-bacterial cleaning products. Plus, anyone enrolled in the ExtraCare Rewards program gets a 20 percent off CVS Shopping Pass upon getting the flu shot in most places.• Seniors, take extra precaution. There’s a high-dose flu shot designed for those 65 and older, who have a greater risk of severe illness from the flu.• Plan ahead: the earlier, the better. It takes up to two weeks for your immunity to build up after getting a flu shot. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone who is at least 6 months old get a flu shot as soon as the vaccine is available.• Stay home if you’re ill. While it may seem like a no-brainer, two-thirds of employed Americans would still go to work even if they were feeling ill with flu-like symptoms. It’s important to understand the preliminary symptoms of the flu and, if you experience them, to stay home. This will help bolster your immune system and prevent the germs spreading.• Practice healthy habits. Door handles, desks and other everyday items are ridden with germs. Wash your hands frequently with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds and avoid touching your mouth and eyes. Additionally, eat nutritious foods, drink plenty of water, and get sufficient sleep to keep your immune system in top shape. Lead by example to educate children about these habits.Learn MoreFor further information and to find a nearby store, visit www.cvs.com/flu or download the CVS/pharmacy mobile app.Don’t Let The Flu Mean Missing Memorable Moments added by new_view_media on December 24, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Medicare Open Enrollment: What You Need To Knowby Patricia Smith(NAPSI)—Every year, millions of Medicare beneficiaries must decide which Medicare Advantage (MA) plan will best serve their needs. During Medicare’s annual open enrollment period, October 15-December 7, you can change MA plans or enroll in one for the first time. Important factors to consider include premium costs, choice of doctors and plan benefits. But there is one other important question: What is the quality rating of the plan?Quality is important because it means better health care and the best value for your money. Medicare uses a system called Star Ratings to assess the quality of plans, awarding plans from one to five stars. These ratings are based on many factors, such as how well the plan does in keeping people healthy and preventing illness, how quickly you can get an appointment and see specialists, and how the plan responds to your complaints and concerns.Today, 65 percent of MA enrollees are in plans with four stars or more, compared to 17 percent in 2009. Eight of the 12 MA plans earning five stars this year are members of the Alliance of Community Health Plans, an organization representing high-quality health plans.You can learn more about MA plans using the Medicare Plan Finder at www.Medicare.gov. The National Committee for Quality Assurance also evaluates quality in MA plans at www.ncqa.org.• Ms. Smith is the president and CEO of the Alliance of Community Health Plans, www.achp.org.Medicare Open Enrollment: What You Need To Know added by new_view_media on December 24, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "How To Plan A Smooth Group Ski Trip(NAPSI)—According to a study from Wyndham Vacation Rentals, most travelers take ski and snowboard vacations in groups of four or more. Hitting the slopes with a big group doesn’t have to be hard, even when it comes to coordinating everyone’s schedules and travel arrangements.Group Ski Trip TipsWhile it can be challenging to keep everyone happy during the vacation, these planning hints can help get everyone started on the right foot.• Find the right lodging. When traveling with a larger group, alternative lodging options might be your best bet. A cabin, condo or home lets everyone stay together under one roof without sacrificing privacy. Everyone can have his or her own bedroom, while common spaces such as a living room or dining room make spending time together easy. Most rental homes also feature a kitchen, which can cut down on the stress of dining out as a large group. Have everyone take a night to prepare dinner. You’ll not only save money, you’ll enjoy time together without the interruptions of a busy restaurant.• Plan for transportation. When researching lodging, see if your accommodations rest along a community shuttle route or offer their own shuttle services. Also look into the destination’s transit systems. Sun Valley, for example, offers free bus service. If you’re renting a car, make sure you plan for times when the group splits up. Leaving half the group stranded won’t make for a fun situation.• Agree on activities beforehand. While skiing and snowboarding may be the top priorities, there are plenty of other activities to do during a ski trip. From dogsledding and snow tubing to unique local festivals, you might find attractions you just don’t want to miss. Have everyone weigh in on top choices before the trip, especially those who are attending but who aren’t avid skiers or snowboarders. Considering everyone’s preferences in advance can help reduce stress during the trip itself.• Give everyone some downtime. Opinions often differ, especially within larger groups, so allow for flexibility during the trip. If your muscles are begging for a break, read a book or squeeze in a post-run nap while your fellow travelers stay on the slopes. If half of the group wants to head downtown for the afternoon while the other half wants to get in another mountain activity, split up for a few hours. By staying flexible with the group’s itinerary, you’ll avoid any tension and better enjoy the time you all spend together.Learn MoreTo start your planning now, you can visit www.WyndhamVacationRentals.com for deals on vacation rental homes in some of North America’s top ski destinations.How To Plan A Smooth Group Ski Trip added by new_view_media on December 22, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

Incorporate whole grains, like sorghum, lean protein, low-fat dairy and fruits and vegetables, for a nutrient-rich meal that will keep you fueled and feeling full until lunch time.Experiment with new flavors. Avoid burnout and boredom by trying new foods. For example, substitute your typical grain with sorghum, an American-grown cereal grain. In addition to its delicious flavor, sorghum is a highly versatile ingredient that is naturally high in fiber, iron and protein and can be used in a wide range of preparations.Eliminate obstacles. If hectic mornings are preventing you from getting a healthy breakfast, find solutions that work for you and your family. Prepare make-ahead foods that you can heat in minutes or look for options that are easy to eat on the go, such as this Triple Sorghum Granola, which can be made ahead and stored in an airtight container to maintain its crunchy texture.Find more ideas for incorporating sorghum into your healthy new year at Facebook.com/TasteSorghum.

      " The Morris County Board of Freeholders invites the public to join them in observing the 14th anniversary of 9/11 at a Remembrance Service and Candlelight Vigil on Sun., Sept. 13.The ceremony will begin at 5 p.m. at the Morris County September 11th Memorial on West Hanover Avenue in Parsippany-Troy Hills, across from the Morris View Healthcare Center and adjacent to the Morris County Public Safety Academy.The event will include a march with a color guard up West Hanover Avenue to the Memorial by police, fire, rescue and emergency personnel from across Morris County.The observance will include a special invocation, a lighting of candles, and reading of the names of each of the Morris County victims, plus a 21-gun salute, and keynote remarks.Elizabeth Schrier, the widow of the late Freeholder Jack Schrier, who was instrumental in getting Morris County’s 9/11 Memorial constructed, will carry the American flag during the ceremony.Morris County’s September 11th Memorial pays tribute to all of those who died in the terrorist attacks in New York, Pennsylvania and Washington D.C., on Sept. 11, 2001, with a special emphasis on the 64 victims from Morris County whose names are etched in plaques that are affixed to the Memorial.The names of all of the nearly 3,000 people who died that day are engraved in ruby-colored paving stones that have been set in the ground as a walkway surrounding the Memorial.“It is vitally important to gather each year on the anniversary of 9/11 to recall every single one of the nearly 3,000 people who were tragically lost to us on that day, including 64 of our Morris County residents,’’ said Freeholder Director Kathy DeFillippo. “Their families and friends should know that the lives of their loved ones will never be forgotten.’’Since seating at the Memorial is limited, the public is encouraged to bring lawn chairs to the outdoor observance. Parking will be available at the Morris County Department of Human Services building at 340 West Hanover Ave., in Morris Township – across from the Academy. Shuttle buses will be available to transport those in need to the Memorial.The freeholders also invite police and fire departments and rescue squads from across the county to participate by sending one apparatus per department and assembling at 6 p.m. at the Morris County Public Safety Academy, 500 West Hanover Ave., in Parsippany-Troy Hills.

      "Morris Arts recently opened a 15th exhibit, entitled Black, White and Green at the Gallery in Morristown.  Guest curator Katherine Murdock, the Exhibition Committee of Morris Arts and the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation selected works by several outstanding artists in New Jersey and New York.\n",
      "Inspired by the biowall, the vertical garden of living plants within the exhibit space, Murdock chose to focus the exhibit on plants and selected the title, Black, White and Green, to purposefully reflect that limited color palette as a means of unifying the exhibit. What is striking, however, is the richness and variety of the artists’ unique approaches to the theme – through their use of different media (collage, oil, cold wax painting, photography, charcoal drawings, wood sculpture, etc.), composition, and subtle gradations of color.As Murdock notes, “Casey Ruble’s paper collage illustrates a bundled bouquet of invasive plant species and Kathy Cantwell’s oil and cold wax on panel explores green color fields that resemble landscape. Richard Bottwin uses plant material as a medium and highlights the wood grain with stain and paint.”The public is invited to view this exciting exhibit, open Mon.-Fri. from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and by appointment, and will remain on display until Aug. 24.  Visit www.morrisarts.org<https://www.morrisarts.org or call 973- 285-5115 for additional information.Morris Arts located in Morristown is a not-for-profit organization founded in 1973 dedicated to building community through the artsBlack, White, Green Art Exhibit Featured In Gallery added by new_view_media on March 19, 2016View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Locals Volunteer To Build A Better Life In GuatemalaBy Cheryl ConwayBeyond the conditions many can relate to, outside the walls of what’s the norm, exists a world so difficult to imagine unless one visits and reaches out to help.In Guatemala City, 11,000 people- in which 7,000 are kids- live and work inside a garbage dump.“Most survive by picking through the trash to earn less than five dollars a day. Many find their daily food in the dump.”Just when all hopelessness is lost for these human beings living in one of the most impoverished areas , more and more volunteers are stepping up to assist and steer them to a better life. Some local people have become very involved and formed an organization known as Beyond The Walls. This month, 75 individuals are volunteering to visit the Guatemala City Garbage Dump to build houses, donate clothing and shoes and organize sport clinics.The non-profit organization started in 2007 at the Mendham Hills Community Church, although mission teams were sent out before.“We had been going to Guatemala for a couple of years,” explains Betsy Ahl of Morris Township, executive director of Beyond The Walls. “The church was sending mission teams. We asked volunteers to help raise money to help pay for trips, build houses. They’d raise more money and that would go toward projects.”In order to influence others outside the church to get involved, and to receive matching grants from volunteers’ employers, organizers decided to expand the church group to a secular, non-profit organization, explains Ahl.The idea to help the people of Guatemala dates back to 2005, when Mendham was named one of the top wealthiest places to live in America.“The elders of Mendham Hills Chapel thought this wasn’t how others lived,” explains Ahl, “so they asked the chairman of the missions’ team to find an area that needed help.”One of the poorest places in the world, the Guatemala City Garbage Dump, was identified by a church member and the idea to team up with the Potter’s House organization, with a mission to eradicate poverty, build houses, help others get business loans and establish community programs.“It’s a ravine right in the center of the Capitol City,” describes Ahl. “They’ve been filling it up with garbage for 50 years.”In their first mission, Ahl joined 26 others for four days. The group, after that, “could have gone to Africa one year, China one year,” but the group decided it was more important to “come back and form long term relationships,” says Ahl who has sponsored three kids in Guatemala in the Kids In Potter House Education Program, in which 50 kids are sponsored to receive an education. Ahl has been sponsoring these kids since they were in the first grade, are now graduating high school and will be supported through college.Church member and organization volunteer, Mike Rubright, 50, of Long Valley, is currently on one of three missions to Guatemala this month through Beyond The Walls. His ninth trip out there during the past seven years, Rubright and his daughter, Erin, are working in the garbage dump from July 18-25.Another one of his daughters, Emily, has gone on the trip seven times but had to miss this one. Youth volunteers must be starting atleast seventh grade to participate, so for Erin this is her third trip. Volunteers must contribute $1,600 each in order to participate, with funds going toward flight and lodging; and additional funds to supplies and building houses. Every year, Rubright sends letters and emails to friends requesting donations to help support his volunteer work.About 75 people have signed up through Beyond The Walls to volunteer during the three missions this month, with 10 people from the Mendham, Long Valley and Chester areas. The others are from areas throughout the country such as Florida, New York and Texas, who formed their own groups with Beyond The Walls.Rubright and his wife, Katie, have a niece who was adopted from Guatemala so their connection is even greater.“I do construction all day long,” says Rubright. “I had no idea what I was doing; I had no construction experience. Now I’m the person in charge of construction projects my week.“Everybody builds, everybody works; it doesn’t matter how old you are,” says Rubright, principal at the Woodglen Middle School in Lebanon Twp.“We build a concrete block house with a concrete floor,” he explains. “We mix concrete by hand; it’s the hardest thing I’ve ever done. The girls and women work harder than I’ve ever seen; they don’t stop.” A family that is getting a house built works beside the volunteers.“It’s not very big,” he says, with the homes about 15 feet by 15 feet,” the size of a bedroom. Homes are for four to five person families, and sometimes six to eight people.It’s like “nine people living in the size of your kitchen,” describes Ahl. Homes are built side by side and cost $5,600 to build.A completed house consists of one big room with one eight-foot partition wall that separates the bedrooms from “everything else,” says Rubright. “They have a toilet and a shower stall” in an area about the size of a closet, and they get “a big concrete sink” that can weigh up to 600 pounds, which is used for all washing needs such as dishes and clothes.Rubright also works under Guatemala masons who are very particular with how they want things to be completed, he says.“They tell us what to do,” says Rubright. “There are a lot of times we do things that don’t make sense; you can’t tell them they are wrong. That’s frustrating. If they tell you to put a hole in a concrete pipe with a hammer and nails, instead of a drill, you do it.”The homes that are being built for the people in the Guatemala City Garbage Dump is luxury compared to the “cardboard sheet metal,” dirt, chemicals, methane gas that surround them and sicken them while living in the dump and “breathing the trash.”These houses also provide shelter and protection for these people, says Rubright, as gun shots are commonly fired in the garbage dump.His goal during this one week visit is to build three to five houses with his group of volunteers.Potter’s House has built 110 homes to date, with 75 contributed by the volunteers of Beyond The Walls, says Ahl, who visits four times, about six weeks a year.In addition to building homes, the volunteers lead soccer clinics and donate uniforms, soccer balls and cleats as well as baseball clinics and donations of t-shirts; help at a medical clinic, vacation Bible school, and deliver groceries and visit families.Through their efforts, much progress has been made such as concrete roads, a community center built last year, education programs which is much needed as the average kid does not go past fifth grade in Guatemala, says Rubright.“A lot of families look at education as not important,” says Rubright. “A lot end up working in the garbage dump” as scavengers. “They make money picking out recyclables. People sift through trash looking through recyclables to see what they can sell” or “they are looking for food to eat it.” Parents stop sending their kids to school because they need their school age kids to watch younger siblings so parents can work.If they are not scavengers, they rely on the garbage dump to sell their own goods, like tortillas to the scavengers so they can eat, and even jewelry, says Ahl.“It’s just this culture of poverty,” says Ahl, with high unemployment. “Education is not a value, that’s the bottom line. Potter’s House tries to teach the value of education especially to the parents.” It also tries to teach the vendors who do sell inside the garbage dump to sell on the outside, says Ahl.“But without education, it’s really, really hard to move their way out of the dump,” says Ahl.Scavengers are even making less these days. As the economy declined, so did the value of recyclables, explains Rubright. For those working 10 to 12 hour days, they are making two to three dollars.While “there are guns everywhere, “Rubright admits that he feels safe when there.“The organization we are with is well respected,” he says, and they stay in a retreat center with accommodations like that of a motel or college dorm. “We are safe; every store has an armed guard,” and no one walks alone. “We have relationships with people. We go to the same neighborhoods. There’s more of a comfort level now. It’s a safe place- I bring my kids there I’m not in fear of our lives.”It is the desire to help others and the appreciation that brings Rubright back to the dump.He says, “If there’s really a God, why does he let that happen? We let it happen by not choosing to use our resources that way. I don’t think I could not go back. They have so little but they appreciate everything they have. We have so much and we want so much more.”They say, “This morning I lived in a garbage dump; now I live in a mansion.”Rubright admits, “I’ve learned more from them than they get from me. I’m a better person in Guatemala than I am here.”Also nice is the community bond shared by the volunteers.For the last five or six years, the same group of people have been volunteering. “Everyone enjoys each other’s company,” say Rubright. “We work hard all day, you come back eat dinner. There’s community; there’s no television, little internet, no cell services. It’s a lot what life should be like.”Like Ahl, the Rubrights have sponsored a girl there since she was eight; now she is 17. Through their support they have helped Jennifer Lopez Munoz continue to go to school and get an education.Rubright tells people, “I have three daughters in America and one in Guatemala.”“All the kids down there, they know when we come back,” says Rubright. “It’s humbling; it’s like family.” Volunteers bring with them bags of clothing and shoes for more than 200 kids.Beyond the Walls has helped other communities outside of Guatemala, such as Native Americans, homeless people in Dover and in Newark.Rubright plans to volunteer at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota next, which is known as the poorest place in the U.S., next to Haiti, from alcoholism and unemployment faced by Native Americans. “This was their country and they are at the bottom of the ladder.”Beyond the Walls is always seeking more volunteers, contributions for clothing and shoes, and financial support.Its next mission to the garbage dump is Oct. 24-31, with already 20 people signed up.Go to Beyondthewalls.org for more information. To volunteer, email gobeyomdthewalls@gmail.com.“I encourage people to go, go somewhere,” says Rubright, Long Valley softball coach for the past 14 years and former school board member. “Find something to do where you can do something for someone else. There are people everywhere who need something. You do not need to be religious. Some people think it’s a church thing – it’s people helping other people.”Locals Volunteer To Build A Better Life In Guatemala added by new_view_media on August 18, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "St. Virgil Group Helps Keep Morris Plains Cleaner And Litter FreeAs the weather gets warmer, groups will be spreading out across Morris Plains to pick up litter and recyclables that have been carelessly tossed along roadways and in parks. The first to participate this year were a group of twelve students from St. Virgil.\n",
      "The St. Virgil group uses their mini grant money to help fund their yearly trip to Appalachia to help do work in this very depressed area. Along with two adults the young people were out on a chilly and drizzly first weekend in April to scour Simones Park. They picked up seven large bags of trash and two large bags of recyclables.\n",
      "Simones Park, at the end of Mountain Way, has been adopted by the sixth grade students from Borough School that have pledged to go out and clean the park four times a year. But Simones Park is a problem area. Even with the Borough School group, extra clean-ups, like this one by St. Virgil, and the help of neighbors that live across the street, litter is a consistent problem. Banners in the park with the litter program logo “Pick Up Morris Plains – Keep Us Litter Free” as a reminder to visitors have helped, but not enough.\n",
      "Litter is unhealthy, unsightly, and can be a safety hazard. Simones Park not only has soccer fields and open areas, but also has a well-used playground, so that broken bottles and crushed cans could lead to injuries.\n",
      "Anyone can help stop litter by using the many recycling containers and trash cans placed throughout the parks, as well as all along the main street, Speedwell Avenue. There is also a recycling container placed across the street from the train station. But even more important, the attitude that causes people to litter must be changed. People tend to think that somebody else will clean up litter left in the street or on the sidewalk, especially in places where there already is a lot of litter or places where the sense of community pride is low.\n",
      "Morris Plains wants everyone to take responsibility for their actions and pride in the environment and the town – don’t litter, put trash and recyclables in their proper place!\n",
      "Morris Plains Councilman John “Jack” Doherty is the liaison to the Clean Communities and Recycling programs and he commended the mini grant groups saying, “We are pleased that so many groups come out during the year to help with litter pickups, but hope our residents will keep our town a “community of caring” and do their part.”\n",
      "The groups that participate receive grant funds from the State Clean Communities Program. Penny Manser is head of the Youth Ministry at St. Virgil and said that, “The mission trip we take each summer is ten days of working with the people of Harlan, Kentucky, the 18th poorest county in the United States. The families there are picked by lottery for help with roofing, plumbing, painting, ditch digging, sheet rock work, siding, clean up from floods or whatever is needed by these local families. It is our opportunity to truly work as disciples in the world, and to learn to be grateful for the gifts that we have.”\n",

      "On Sun., Sept. 13 Macculloch Hall Historical Museum welcomes Linda J. Barth from the Canal Society of New Jersey (CSNJ) Barth will present a program about The Delaware and Raritan Canal (D&R). The D&R is one of the subjects of the current second floor gallery exhibit “Canals of New Jersey” which will be available to view prior to the presentation.Canal author and historian Linda J. Barth will introduce the people, the bridges, the locks, and the aqueducts that made D&R Canal work. This waterway, now a “greenway” and the centerpiece of a popular state park, transported men and supplies between New York and Philadelphia during three wars. Inventor John Holland used the canal to deliver his Holland VI submarine to Washington for its Navy trials, and luxury yachts, like J .P. Morgan’s Tarantula, cruised the waterway.For more than 170 years, the D&R Canal has meandered across the narrow waist of New Jersey and was one of the nation’s most successful towpath canals, carrying more tonnage in 1866 than the more famous Erie Canal. Johnson & Johnson, Roebling, and Fleischmann’s Distillery all had their start along the D&R. These days the canal provides the people of central New Jersey with both a water supply and a premier recreational facility. Today, the Morris Canal Greenway, a partnership between local communities and the Canal Society of New Jersey, seeks to preserve the surviving historic remains of the canal, interpret canal sites, and offer recreational opportunities to the public. In this presentation Linda will discuss the history and operation of the canal and how it is used today.MHHM opens at 1 p.m. on Sept. 13 and visitors who arrive prior to the 4:30 p.m. program can enjoy the “Canals of New Jersey” exhibit. MHHM has partnered with CSNJ to present this display of panels that tell the story of New Jersey’s two towpath canals, the Morris and the Delaware and Raritan. The CSNJ’s display is supplemented by objects including some from MHHM’s collection and information about Macculloch Hall founder George Macculloch who had the idea for the Morris Canal. The exhibit shares some of the stories of the workers and families who lived and worked on the canal, as well as other details about its construction using photographs and drawings, as well objects such as model canal boats.Tickets for the program go on sale from 1 p.m., no advance sales, and remain on sale until the presentation begins at 4:30 p.m. Speaker tickets include admission to the museum exhibits during the afternoon and a guided tour of period rooms, the last tour ticket is sold at 3 p.m. Speaker tickets will remain on sale until 4:30 p.m.The Museum’s second floor “The Civil War Through the Eyes of Thomas Nast” and “Canals of New Jersey” exhibits will remain on view until 4:30 p.m. The first floor “Thomas Nast: Unknown Works and American Icons” exhibit will close 3:30 p.m. – 4 p.m. in preparation for the program. Tickets to hear speakers are Adults $8; Seniors & Students $6; Children 6 – 12 $4. Members and children under 5 are admitted free.For more information call Karen Hollywood, Publicity and Programs Coordinator Macculloch Hall Historical Museum at (973) 538-2404 ext. 15.Linda Barth To Speak At MHHM added by new_view_media on August 16, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "An Evening with The Monkees\n",
      "Featuring Micky Dolenz and Peter TorkThursday, August 27 at 8 pm(Morristown) – Hey, hey it’s The Monkees, featuring Micky Dolenz and Peter Tork, coming to Mayo Performing Arts Center on Thursday, August 27, 2015 at 8 pm. Tickets are $49-99.When four young men were cast in the television roles of a struggling rock band inspired by The Beatles’ A Hard Day’s Night, few could have predicted the impact The Monkees would make on music and pop culture at large, an impact that still reverberates 50 years later.Assembled in Los Angeles in 1965 by Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider for the television series The Monkees, the quartet of Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith, Peter Tork, and the late Davy Jones brought a singular mix of pop, rock, psychedelica, Broadway, and country to their music. The show itself, meanwhile, paid tribute not only to The Beatles, but also to the comedy stylings of The Marx Brothers and Laurel and Hardy as well as the pop-art sensibilities of Warhol and the emerging San Francisco psychedelic scene.The Monkees’ first single, “Last Train to Clarksville,” was released in August 1966, hitting #1 and serving as advance publicity for their series, which debuted on September 12. When the group’s self-titled debut album arrived in stores a month later, it quickly headed for the top spot of the Billboard charts, where it would ultimately sit for 13 of the 78 weeks it remained in the Top 200. (Two decades later, in the midst of a new burst of Monkee-mania, The Monkees popped back onto the charts, bringing the total number of weeks to 102.)By the time the group’s TV series aired its final new episode on March 25, 1968, the Monkees had seen three further albums top the charts – More of the Monkees, Headquarters, and Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones, Ltd., all of which were released in 1967, staggeringly enough – while racking up several more hit singles, with “I’m a Believer,” “(I’m Not Your) Steppin’ Stone,” “A Little Bit Me, A Little Bit You,” “The Girl I Knew Somewhere,” “Pleasant Valley Sunday,” “Words,”  “Daydream Believer,” “Valleri,” and “Tapioca Tundra” all finding their way into the Billboard Top 40.After the series’ two-season run, the group went on to star in the cult feature film HEAD (co-written by Jack Nicholson) and a TV special (33 1/3 Revolutions per Monkee) while also continuing to record new material, but much as the ’60s gave way to the ’70s, the members of the Monkees eventually gave in to their individual musical interests and went their separate ways. for awhile.In February 1986, after MTV broadcast a marathon of The Monkees, Dolenz, Jones, and Tork reunited for a 20th anniversary tour, with Nesmith joining them onstage for the Los Angeles date of the tour, and in 1996, all four members of the group reunited for a new album (Justus) and TV special (Hey, Hey, It’s the Monkees).In the wake of Jones’s death on February 29, 2012, the surviving members of the Monkees reunited and performed a series of concerts. The shows were greeted with sell-out response and phenomenal reviews. Now, Micky Dolenz and Peter Tork carry on that tradition with a full evening of magic music and multi-media splendor, including clips from their Emmy Award winning series. Their new show features all of the Monkees hits, plus an intimate acoustic set and solo spots for each of the singers. An Evening With The Monkees is sure to please every fan of the band.Mayo Performing Arts Center, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, presents a wide range of programs that entertain, enrich, and educate the diverse population of the region and enhance the economic vitality of Northern New Jersey.

      "While Mother Nature has been kind to northwest New Jersey, humanity’s innate imperfection has stepped in to cause monumental fires, mine disasters, explosions, and aircraft collisions throughout the 20th century.MCHS will officially open its new exhibit, Up in Smoke: Northern New Jersey’s Worst Man-Made Disasters: 1910-1989, at Acorn Hall. This photo-driven exhibit brings heroes to light, recognizes the sacrifices of those lost, and illustrates the varied events that brought communities together, tightened safety regulations, and changed legislation nationally.  Up in Smoke covers twelve 20th-century disasters, five from Morris and seven from its contiguous counties that, due to their scale, severity, loss of life, or ability to cause major changes in workplace safety or fire science, stand as benchmarks with ominous connotations. Still, in understanding the severity of the situations, heroes, some as martyrs, emerge answering a call beyond requirements of duty and advancing our common cause.Up in Smoke will be available through April 26, 2020.MCHS is located at Acorn Hall, 68 Morris Avenue, Morristown, and is open Wednesdays and Thursdays, 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., and Sundays, 1-4 p.m. Admission, which includes the exhibits and landscaped grounds, is $6 for adults, $5 for seniors, $3 for students, and is free for children under 12 and MCHS members. Founded in 1945, MCHS is a member-supported 501 (c)3 organization whose mission is to preserve and promote the history of Morris County. Up in Smoke: Disasters That Made History in Northern New Jersey added by new_view_media on November 4, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "By Henry M. HoldenThe Raritan Headwaters Association [RHA] was formed in a 2011 merger of two successful nonprofit conservation groups, the Upper Raritan Watershed Association [URWA] and the South Branch Watershed Association [SBWA], both founded in 1959, to engage New Jersey residents in safeguarding water sources.Then, there were few laws to protect clean water and air. The first Earth Day and the Federal Clean Water Act were more than a decade away, and the Clean Air Act was several years in the future.Today, the RHA currently owns 10 preserves and natural areas totaling about 415 acres. It is known as a state leader in environmental education and outreach, and for their work in water quality monitoring, ecological research, habitat restoration, land preservation and active volunteer stewardship.A watershed is the area of land that drains into a body of water such as a river, lake, stream or bay. The 470-square-mile watershed region is a part of the Raritan River Basin which drains into the Raritan Bay, and eventually the Atlantic Ocean. The watershed is geographically defined by the ridges and valleys of the upper Raritan watershed which is in three counties, Hunterdon, Morris and Somerset.“There are no political boundaries for a watershed,” said Cindy Ehrenclou, executive director of the RHA. “We are partially in 38 municipalities. We’re about what is in streams and groundwater in the underground aquifers which is a source of drinking water. Eighty-percent of the people in our region get their drinking water from private wells. If we want to know about the health of our watershed, we hold community well-testing events. We partner with municipalities such as Randolph, Chester, or Bedminster, for example. We sell water test kits (at a nominal fee) two weeks every year and people go to their Townhall and pick up their well test kits.”“We collect them and get everything sampled at a certified lab. The information we collect is private. For us it is a way to accumulate data which will give us the health of the water supply. For the homeowner, it gives them the opportunity to see if their drinking water is safe. We’re doing the science, collecting the data on the health of the water. For instance, in Redington we discovered a trend for arsenic in the water supply. People would not normally know that they were being exposed to this dangerous substance. So, we will sit down with them and ask about how old is their well, and how deep is the well? It’s a little more personal than going to a store and buying a water testing kit. People should be testing the water on a yearly basis. If not them, then who?”Every April, RWA sponsors a massive volunteer cleanup of rivers, streams and waterways in the region. “This year, 1,700 volunteers picked up 18-tons of trash at 46 sites along rivers, streams, lakes, and pines in our watershed, in just three hours,” said Ehrenclou.“We picked up everything from tires to shopping carts. All kinds of debris ends up in the streams. We use the data we collect, and we share it with Bill Kibler, who is our policy director. He goes down to Trenton to make the lawmakers aware of this issue.” “There is a ‘single-use’ plastic bag Bill still pending in Trenton, so we can provide the science to defend those kinds of policies being established. We can say, ‘in three hours, on April 13, we picked up 18-tons of debris. In that debris were 9,000 plastic bags and 3,000 plastic bottles. These numbers are compelling because we are doing the science. We did a micro plastic study in South Branch, and we found that the micro plastics are making it through the water treatment plants.”“These plastic bags and bottles overtime break down into smaller and smaller pieces and they are not being treated in treatment plants. They are going right into a drinking water supply, and nobody has a clue as to how dangerous this is.”Another issue the RHA is dealing with is stormwater runoff. “Contaminated stormwater runoff this past summer is why Lake Hopatcong and Spruce Run, major summer entertainment spots and other lakes were closed,” said Ehrenclou. “They’re dealing with stormwater runoff from fertilizers, from oils in a parking lot and other contaminants.”“Stormwater runoff is the biggest problem in our waterways today,” Ehrenclou said. “Once you cut down the forest and you pave it over with ballfields, grass and parking lots, it becomes compressed land. When it rains the water runs off carrying with it any pollutants that are on the ground, such as wildlife droppings, fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, oil from cars, and pet wastes, and even runoff from septic tanks. It all rushes into the stream because it does not have the trees and vegetation to slow it down and filter it, so, it’s going to end up in the waterways.”“The water may look clear, but then suddenly you see algae bloom which will make the water warmer and more toxic. Harmful algae blooms occur when there is too much phosphorus introduced into a lake. When this happens, and it’s sunny and hot- photosynthesis occurs and the phosphorus turns into toxic bacteria, (cyanobacteria), a blue-green mix that can cause rashes to flu-like symptoms in humans and, in some cases, death in pets.”“It’s just not a good situation. Some people say ‘oh it will fix itself’ but that doesn’t always happen. Sometimes an intervention will help, but other times there is permanent damage to the environment. Everything you do on land affects the water quality.” “It all comes from stormwater runoff, and the damage occurs when there is a big development, such as changing a forest into ballfields and parking lots.” For more information see www.raritanheadwaters.org  Captions:Photo 1- Ideally, the spring thaws will melt the snow and any harmful substances on the snow will be filtered through the ground before the substances enter the waterways, (Credit Henry M.

      " ORGANIZED ANNUAL PUBLIC FORUM AND LED STIGMA-FREE INITIATIVE The Morris County Board of Freeholders this week honored retiring county behavioral health director Laurie Becker for a job well done over the past 21 years in caring for the needs of Morris County’s most vulnerable residents.  Becker, who retired on Oct.1, was presented with a county resolution by the county governing board at its work session in Morristown. The honoree also was lauded by leaders of the Morris County nonprofit community, such as Homeless Solutions, NewBridge Services, Market Street Mission, Mental Health Association, and others who attended the ceremony.  “Since she started with the county in 1998, Laurie has devoted herself to the mission of serving those most in need, especially those struggling with mental illness and substance use disorders,’’ said Freeholder Director Doug Cabana.  “She has demonstrated exemplary leadership in her service to the residents of Morris County, and is truly deserving of our thanks and congratulation.’’ Laurie Becker: “I am overwhelmed by the people who are here today to help transport me through this significant transition. I have worked with so many of you over the years. I am truly blessed.’’ Laurie Becker started working for Morris County on Jan. 26, 1998, in the Community and Behavioral Health Services Division. She rose through the ranks to become Director of the Division of Community and Behavioral H. She has effectively overseen the implementation and operation of an agency, which provides more than $10 million annually in grants to community providers that care for the needs of Morris County residents.  Over the years, she engaged community partners in her collaborative work through the Mental Health Addictions Services Advisory Board, Youth Services Advisory Committee, Human Services Advisory Committee, and Municipal Alliances.  For the past two decades, she has coordinated the annual Morris County Public Forum for Consumers and Families, giving residents a chance to have a voice in how the system works for them, allowing consumers to offer constructive feedback that has led to improvements in operations and service.  Becker also has been a leader in countywide Disaster Response Crisis Counseling, taking lead roles in responses to Hurricane Irene, Superstorm Sandy, the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, and many more incidents to provide comfort, support and resources to residents in need of assistance.  In addition, her work and leadership on the countywide Stigma-Free Initiative has made it a major success in Morris County, where she has worked closely with towns, schools, hospitals, nonprofit partners, law enforcement and faith-based organizations to help grow the fledgling initiative into a success that now reaches across our county. FREEHOLDERS HONOR COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CHIEF LAURIE BECKER ON HER RETIREMENT added by new_view_media on November 4, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "by Elsie Walker Halloween will soon be here.  Many times on Halloween, or around camp fires, stories of ghosts; strange, creepy or haunted places; and recollections of strange occurrences are shared.  Some people pass stories on from generation to generation until they become legend. However, others, like members of the New Jersey Ghost Hunters Society (NJGHS), investigate strange occurrences to see if there is a paranormal presence involved.  Recently, people from around the coverage area shared stories and sightings of local ghosts, rumors of haunted locations, and experiences with the paranormal. Members of the online, “You Know You’re From Roxbury Township….” group recalled ghost tales and scary sights.  One popular ghost story was the Hooker Man. It is about a ghost seen by the Succasunna railroad tracks. “The Hooker Man lost his hand in some freak train accident, and now searches for it with a lantern,” shared Mike Stark, Roxbury.   However, it appears the Hooker Man has not only been seen in Roxbury, but Netcong, Flanders, Chester, and Long Valley also lay claim to the legend. Cheryl McClung, a former area resident, who now lives in Georgia, shared, “At night, people see his [the Hooker Man’s] lantern bouncing along the tracks in Flanders on the west side of [Route} 206. Dawn Traetta Hair, of Florida, another former Roxbury resident, remembers the stories of the former location of the Church of the Mystic Light in Flanders.  The building is closed, but there had been claims that witches had hung chickens and have had seances there. People still stop by it, out of curiosity, if not scared away.Kim Howell Candore shared that there have been ghost sightings at her childhood home, “I was raised at 11 Meeker Street [in] Succasunna, next to the cemetery. There has been many spottings of two men in Civil War uniforms smoking, sitting on a tree stump in front of our old house,”   said Candore, who now lives in Tennessee. Candore remembers that the two churches on Main Street, adjacent to the cemetery, used to be a military hospital. Also shared, was that Roxbury has its very own “haunted house” in the form of the Halloween House, a tremendous display put on by the Heard family in Roxbury.Hackettstown is the meeting site of the NJ Ghost Hunters Society.  The society’s mission statement is “To search out definitive proof of life beyond the grave.  To provide paranormal investigations to those who request them, free of charge. To train those individuals, who so desire and become members of the NJGHS, in the protocols of professional, ethical and scientific paranormal investigating..” L’aura  Hladik Hoffman is the society’s founder and director. She is the author of Ghosthunting New Jersey, Ghosthunting New York City, and Ghosts of the Poconos and has a variety of presentations on the paranormal which will be given at area libraries this month  (listed on the bottom of www.njghs.net/presentations.html). Recently, Hoffman recalled stories she was told of two ghosts who are said to haunt Bea McNally’s (formerly Charlie Brown Restaurant).  In 1878, the place was the Clarendon House (hotel) and from 1926-1947 it was the Hackettstown Inn.  “The ghost girl appeared to a young girl who was living at the hotel when her family owned it. She snuck down to the kitchen in the middle of the night for some ice cream. When she was headed out of the kitchen and into the dining room to sneak back upstairs, she was met with this bright, sparkling light and out of the light stepped a young girl – about the same age of the girl sneaking the ice cream – and the ghost girl was dressed from a different time period and clutching her teddy bear. The ice cream girl screamed, dropped the ice cream and ran up to her room. The next day when her parents confronted her about the mess in the dining room, they did not believe her about the ghost girl she saw. However, a couple weeks later, the father saw the ghost girl, too.”As for the other ghost, Hoffman said there are various origin stories as to who he is. Most have to do with drowning. Two versions have him as a child who was staying upstairs and died while unattended in the bathtub.  Hoffman shared that in another version of the story, “A Lady of the Evening was distraught over unrequited love of one of her clients and she took a bath and drank a bottle of gin and passed out and drowned.” However, most seem to think the ghost is a child as they have got the sensation of someone wanting to ride on their shoulders or putting a small hand into theirs.Over the years there have been other stories of ghostly presence at the location, such as unexplained footsteps and, when there was a pool hall at the location, how when it was unlocked for business one day,  instead of the cleaned pool hall, cues, etc. were strung all over. In Pompton Lakes, Laura Jennings, a member of the historic commission there, shared about some caring spirits at the Schuyler Colfax house ( Hamburg turnpike, Wayne)  “Dr. Jane Colfax Young grew up in the house with her father (Dr. Richard S. Colfax) and Aunt (also Dr. Jane Colfax). Katherine Young, daughter to Jane Colfax Young, shared that she spent a lot of time in the home until he was ten years old. Both her and her father felt and saw things in the house that they are sure were the spirits of their ancestors watching over them. The Colfax family is one of the founding families in the area.”Jennings also shared that she had heard reports of ghost sightings at the Lenox School in Pompton Plains.Morristown has had its own dealing with the paranormal.  Pat Goodfriend, Membership & Volunteer Coordinator for the Morris County Historical Society shared a short 2016 article by Y. McGreevy on Ford Mansion. The mansion at the Morristown National Historical Park is over 200 years old.  Once the home of George Washington (briefly during 1780), the mansion drew the interest of Gordon Thomas Ward, a paranormal investigator, who in 2016, did a presentation on the Mansion and his two-year study of it, including the noises said to be coming from inside its walls.  An article by B. LaMuraglia the same year shows that during the time of his investigation, Ward heard the voices of three male and two female spirits.  None were Washington; Ward felt at least one could have been a kitchen servant. Bells Mansion, near the Netcong-Stanhope border has also been the subject of a paranormal study.  That was shared by Tom Lupo of Hopatcong, a producer who followed the NJ Ghost Hunters Society when it investigated the restaurant six years ago.  The segment includes a worker recalling seeing the spirit of a woman. He was cleaning up after the restaurant had closed. There are windows between the rooms.  He looked up and saw a woman, seated in the next room, looking out at the road. He watched her for about 10 seconds and then went to approach her. When he walked into that room, she was gone. This Halloween, will the Hooker Man or the little girl ghost at Bea McNally’s be seen?  Will voices whisper through Ford Mansion or the Lenox School? Perhaps, this year, a new spirit will be seen and its legend begun. Hauntings Around the Area for Halloween added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "By Jerry Del Priore  On September 13th, the Mayo Performing Arts Center (MPAC) kicked off its 25th anniversary with a fabulous concert by singer/actress and American Idol finalist Katherine McPhee. MPAC, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, has been at the center of Morristown’s revitalization and is a major reason why it’s a nightlife hotspot today, with several wonderful bars and restaurants lining its lively streets since its inception, according to General Manager Ed Kirchdoerffer. “Twenty-five years ago, Morristown wasn’t the popular town it is now,” Kirchdoerffer, a Morristown native, said. “We feel the opening of the performing arts center was part of the rebuilding of Morristown. It’s been an anchor for improvement.” Top musical and comedic acts have performed at MPAC over the years, from Foreigner and Daughtry to Melissa Ethridge and Wayne Brady, and every great entertainer in between. Moreover, MPAC doesn’t have any plans of slowing down any time soon. Musical performers such as America, Kenny G, Joan Jett and the Blackhearts and Ruben Studdard will be hitting the stage in October. “We feel we’re still in a growth cycle,” Kirchdoerffer said. “We constantly challenge ourselves to grow and invest in ourselves to make the best possible events.”  Kirchdoerffer said some of the ways MPAC will be celebrating its 25 years in Morristown are by holding a few free concerts, ask its performance-goers, on social media, to name their favorite moments since its opening, and have a number of $25 ticket offers, to name a few.  However, MPAC is more than a concert hall for some of today’s greatest acts. It also offers a Performing Arts School (PAS), founded in 2006, which now serves approximately 700 students per year with over 20 classes a week within a supportive and creative atmosphere. Students ages five to 18 come from all over Northern New Jersey to learn performance technique while building confidence and having a great time. Classes are offered in musical theatre, acting, singing technique, song presentation, improvisation, private voice and adult cabaret. “The emphasis isn’t placed on being a star,” Kirchdoerffer explained. “It’s placed on being part of a team, being part of the creative process. They really get a full immersive experience. Everyone’s so encouraging of everyone else.” While most of the kids don’t enter the entertainment world, Kirchdoerffer noted that they will gain valuable skills that will help them succeed in life. “Most won’t go on to become performers,” he said, “but they will learn important life skills that will go a long way, whether it’s in the boardroom or other areas of work.”Additionally, MPAC offers The Miracle Project, a fully inclusive music and theatre program for children with autism of all levels. “It’s been a very powerful program,” Kirchdoerffer said. “This is a program that grew organically. Many parents have spoken about (their experiences) and are happy to see their kids enjoy themselves. This (program) gives them a safe haven. They get to have fun while being themselves.” There’s also an Art Upstairs Gallery, located in the balcony lobby of MPAC, which showcases visual artists from a variety of disciplines, including watercolor, oils, photography, sculpture and more. Each year, the works of over 200 artists are showcased in group exhibits. Each display hangs from six to eight weeks.With all the success MPAC has experienced over the last 25 years, Kirchdoerffer said he hopes to see more prosperous years ahead for the Morristown institution, which has been a staple in the thriving town. “We have been here for 25 years and hope to do it for 25 more years and beyond,” he said. “It’s been the town’s heartbeat.” For more information on MPAC’s educational programs, Art Upstairs Gallery, and a list of upcoming performances, go to www.mayoarts.org. Mayo Performing Arts Center Celebrates 25 Years of Prosperity  added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "By Henry M. HoldenThe Morristown Festival of Books is an annual two-day event that takes place this year on October 11 and 12. According to Rachel Barry, Director of the Morristown Festival of Books, “The 6-year-old event is modeled after successful book festivals in other communities throughout the world. Each autumn, the festival brings together authors with readers and book lovers. The Festival is New Jersey’s premier book festival, celebrating the written word’s power to challenge, transport and transform.” Barry says the festival is growing each year. “We started with about 1,500 visitors six years ago and last year we hosted over 8,000.”The opening night is a ticketed Keynote Event featuring Preet Bharara who served as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York from 2009 to 2017. In 2017, Bharara joined the NYU School of Law faculty as a Distinguished Scholar in Residence. Bharara will speak on Friday evening at the Mayo Performing Arts Center at 7:30pm. Tickets will be available through the MPAC box office and on the festival website. Tickets are also available at the door on the night of the event, as availability allows.The Main Festival takes place all day on Saturday (10 a.m. – 5 p.m.), rain or shine.This year’s festival features more than 50 authors. Author selections featuring various genres are designed to appeal to a variety of ages and reading interests. “Authors will be speaking and answering questions in informal one-hour indoor sessions at five festival venues throughout the day,” said Barry. “Immediately following his or her talk, you will have the opportunity to speak with your favorite authors and have your books personalized at the Author Signing Tent, on the Vail Mansion lawn.” These sessions are free, no tickets required; general seating is on a first-come, first-served basis. There will also be portable restrooms at the Vail Mansion lawn. “The Festival center is on the lawn in front of the historic Vail Mansion (110 South Street), where there is an Information Tent, a Book Tent selling copies of the visiting authors’ books, the Signing Tent where authors will greet visitors and sign books, and concession stands selling refreshments.”“This year’s closing event is an exciting interactive event called Pitchapalooza,” said Barry. “It’s like American Idol for books (only without Simon). Anyone with an idea for a book has the chance to pitch it to a panel of judges. But they get only one minute.”The hosts, Arielle Eckstut and David Henry Sterry (a.k.a. The Book Doctors) team up with guest industry insiders to form the judging panel. The Judges critique everything from idea to style to potential in the marketplace and much more. Whether potential authors pitch themselves, or simply listen to trained professionals critique each presentation, Pitchapaloozas are educational and entertaining for all. All attendees come away with concrete advice on how to improve their pitch as well as a greater understanding of the ins and outs of the publishing industry.At the end of each Pitchapalooza, the judges come together to pick a winner. That winner receives an introduction by Eckstut and Sterry to an agent or publisher who is appropriate for their work. The Festival audience will also have a chance to pick a winning pitch. That Audience Choice winner will be voted on by the audience and will receive a 30-minute phone consultation from Eckstut and Sterry (a $150 value).KidFest @ MFOB includes author talks, signings, and fun activities all day for children up to 12 years old. Additionally, concessions will be available in the KidFest outdoor area outside the Presbyterian Church Parish House at 65 South Street. Please note, the festival is not held on the Morristown Green. There are several public parking garages within walking distance of the Festival center. This is a casual event. Wear comfortable walking shoes and be prepared for cool weather. It is a rain or shine event, so please bring an umbrella if the day’s weather warrants it. For more information and a list of authors attending see: www.morristownbooks.orgThe Morristown Festival of Books is Back added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "How To Combat Cold And Flu(NAPSI)—According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), chances are good you’ll get a cold or the flu this year. Adults have an average of two to three colds per year and children have even more, while 5 to 20 percent of the population gets the flu. Fortunately, there are steps you can take to minimize your risk and ease your symptoms.Consider these tips from Chloraseptic® pharmacist spokesperson Maria Mantione:• Get a flu shot. The CDC recommends a flu shot for everyone over the age of 6 months. It’s easy to get—just talk to your pharmacist. It’s the best way to prevent the spread of the flu. It does not prevent the common cold, but the flu is a devastating, serious illness that could put you out of commission for a week or more or, even worse, land you in the hospital with pneumonia or infect someone you love with a weaker immune system—such as babies, the elderly or those undergoing chemotherapy.• Wash your hands often. Washing your hands with soap and water is the best way to prevent the spread of the common cold.• Prevent illness by practicing healthy habits. Make sure to get enough sleep, eat a balanced, nutritious diet, exercise and minimize stress.• If you do get sick, talk to your pharmacist about how to manage your symptoms with medications. Before cold season, stock your medicine cabinet with the essentials. Stick to single-ingredient products, so you have what you need to treat your specific symptoms. These include pain relievers and fever reducers, a decongestant, cough medicine, lozenges and a sore throat spray. Topical medications, such as Chloraseptic sore throat sprays and lozenges, are great to have on hand because they’re portable, can be used safely with other cold medicines and have very few side effects.In fact, Chloraseptic is the No. 1 sore throat relief brand around. It provides fast-acting relief for sore throats and mouth pain to help you get through your day.From lozenges that soothe nasal passages and suppress coughs to sprays that target pain when and where it hurts, there’s a broad portfolio of products based on your preferences and needs.The lozenges have a soothing liquid center that relieves pain and cools nasal passages. MAX Wild Berry is the strongest throat relief lozenge in the line. Chloraseptic Total offers a multisymptom lozenge formula that can suppress your cough for up to four hours.Chloraseptic’s sprays are the No. 1 pharmacist-recommended brand. The new and improved Cherry Spray tastes great, works on contact and is free of aspirin, sugar and gluten. The MAX Wild Berry Targeted Throat Spray is convenient for travel or to keep in your purse. The targeted spray makes it easier when you’re on the go to coat and protect specific areas in your mouth and throat. All these products are available at mass retailers, major drugstores and grocery stores.Also helping to keep you ahead of the flu this season is an online Cold + Flu tracker. To check for outbreaks and symptoms, go to www.chloraseptic.com, click on Cold + Flu Tracker and enter your zip code.How To Combat Cold And Flu added by new_view_media on December 22, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Helping Older People to Maintain Independence(NAPSI)—For most older adults, the ability to live independently is associated with the ability to drive. That’s one reason the prospect of eventually “giving up the keys” can be a frightening one.To help, the experts on aging at the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging (n4a) developed a brochure called “Before You Give Up the Keys: Create a Roadmap for Transportation Independence” that may lessen those fears by empowering older adults to evaluate their mobility needs, identify the transportation options in their community and develop a plan customized to their unique circumstances.“A too-familiar scenario is that older adults wait until they’re involved in some sort of emergency, like a traffic accident, before they really think about their driving ability and the other transportation options available to them in their community,” said n4a CEO Sandy Markwood. “Our goal is to shed light on a critical issue that will likely affect most families with an older loved one who may need to limit or eliminate their driving, and to provide a catalyst for discussion, and hopefully, action,” Markwood also noted.The n4a represents America’s national network of 623 Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs). It helps older adults and people with disabilities live with dignity and choices in their homes and communities for as long as possible.To that end, it created the Eldercare Locator. This serves as an essential, trusted gateway to help older adults, caregivers and health professionals navigate the maze of aging programs and services, as well as to assist them in identifying and accessing the resources that match their needs best. The National Call Center operates five days a week from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET and can be reached at 800-677-1116 or www.eldercare.gov.According to recent research by the Federal Transit Administration, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, n4a and the National Aging and Disability Transportation Center, the rise in the 65-plus population—some 45 million and growing—has triggered a corresponding spike in the number of nondrivers of more than 1.1 million between 2001 and 2009.“This is a major issue for older adults because when they lack access to transportation, they can’t get to the doctor, the grocery store or see friends and family as much, which means their overall well-being is likely to suffer,” added Kathy Greenlee, Assistant Secretary for Aging.Free BrochureTo download the free brochure, go to www.n4a.org/files/ResourcesforOlderAdults.pdf.

      "Protect Your Health, Protect Your Toothbrush(NAPSI)—Did you know that keeping your toothbrush clean is a simple way to help protect your health and the health of your loved ones year-round, and especially during flu season?Dentists’ Advice for the Entire FamilyAccording to pediatric dentist Danielle Gilbert-Fowler, D.M.D., “Oral health is not just about your mouth, it’s about your overall health. The mouth is a major doorway for all sorts of microorganisms, which can be linked to anything from the common cold to heart disease and diabetes. Hence, the importance of having a healthy mouth cannot be overstated.”“More than 300 kinds of microorganisms thrive in the human mouth,” explains Astrid Shroetter, D.D.S. “What’s more, the typical toothbrush is reused for months and never cleaned thoroughly.”Research indicates that kids get sick on average about 10 times a year—that’s almost once a month. While dentists and parents both encourage good oral hygiene, it would be nice to do so without worrying about potential reinfection caused by brushing teeth with contaminated toothbrushes. As Dr. Gilbert-Fowler puts it, “You wouldn’t clean your house with a dirty washcloth. Why clean your teeth with a dirty toothbrush?”A Solution“It’s important to keep toothbrushes in a clean environment and separate from other toothbrushes,” recommends Gilbert-Fowler. “Use of a Steripod® clip-on toothbrush protector will help keep your toothbrush clean and protect against outside contaminants and cross contamination from other toothbrushes. It’s important for kids and adults alike to replace toothbrushes every three months or more frequently after any illness.”Developed by doctors and independently tested for efficacy at an accredited lab, Steripod is a clip-on protector that fits any standard or electric toothbrush. Using a patented natural vapor shield of thymol, derived from the thyme plant, Steripod keeps toothbrushes fresh and clean for up to three months. Simply clip it on your electric or manual toothbrush and it goes to work; no cables or batteries are needed. You can use it at home, work, the gym, school or when you travel.More Pearls of Wisdom for Your Pearly Whites:To further put the bite on dental disease, heed these five tips from the experts at the American Dental Association:1. Brush your teeth twice a day for two minutes with a soft-bristled brush.2. Replace your toothbrush every three or four months, or if the bristles are frayed.3. Use an ADA-accepted fluoride toothpaste.4. Clean between teeth daily with floss.5. Visit your dentist regularly for professional cleanings and oral exams.Learn MoreVisit www.GetSteripod.com or call (310) 204-7880.Protect Your Health, Protect Your Toothbrush added by new_view_media on December 22, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Five words or less(NewsUSA) – With everything that goes into your wedding day, those once-in-a-lifetime moments will go by in a blur, which is why hiring a professional wedding photographer is a must. After all, the last thing you should be worrying about is whether your photographer will be able to capture your big day.\n",
      "The key? Prepare yourself so that you can accurately evaluate the “right” photographer for you.\n",
      "“The best photographer will take the time to build a rapport with you and use his or her experience and creativity to capture the mood, personality, ambiance and even the geography of your wedding,” says PPA (Professional Photographers of America) photographer Berit Bizjak. “The finest wedding photography is more than a series of still pictures. It’s physical poetry — it tells the story of the day and portrays the essence of both people and place.”\n",
      "To this end, PPA, the largest international nonprofit association created by professional photographers, has taken the guesswork out of the process by offering six tips to help you plan your wedding photos like a pro:\n",
      "1. Book far in advance. The best photographers get booked quickly — sometimes as much as a year in advance — so don’t wait until the last minute to book your photographer.\n",
      "2. Show them the money. Now is not the time to skimp on your photo budget. Call around and get a price range for services, and remember: after the cake is long gone, and the dress is stored away, your wedding photos will be the only things left to share and enjoy for years to come, so don’t cut too many corners on your photography budget — you’ll end up regretting it.\n",
      "3. Make sure your photographer is a real pro. Only hire someone who has liability insurance, experience taking the style of photos you want, backup equipment and a plan for when things go south. Ideally, he or she is a PPA photographer. PPA photographers do more than just snap pictures. They have the technical expertise and artistry to make you look your best and bring your vision to life. They also abide by a strict code of ethics that makes a real difference. Watch this (video) to see real married couples share their stories.\n",
      "4. Request to see a full gallery of real weddings. Look at full wedding coverage (not just a small selection of each wedding’s best moments) to see a photographer’s true style and get a sense of how he or she might tell your “story.” Do you prefer more artistic or traditional poses? Would you rather have a photojournalist approach or a mix of all styles?\n",
      "5.Work with your photographer to create a detailed shot list. PPA wedding photographers can also help you create that shot list, as they know what key moments tell a wedding story and can prepare for those. But talk about your must-haves, and walk through the entire program with your photographer ahead of time. Share your expectations ahead of time to ensure that he or she captures the key shots, while remaining attentive and available to catch the best candid moments.\n",
      "6. Plan your post-wedding photo strategy• ahead of time! Almost as soon as the festivities are over, you’ll be eager to look at the photos so you can relive your big day over and over again. Ask your photographer for teasers or a “sneak peek” and a timeline for when the rest of the pictures will be available. Will they give you an online gallery for family and friends to choose the images they want? Again, knowing these things ahead of time will make things easy on the back end, sparing you any heartache.6 Tips for Planning Your Wedding Photos Like a Pro added by new_view_media on December 22, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Wedding Gifts for Grooms: A Tradition Brides Shouldn’t Ignore\n",
      "Five words or less(NewsUSA) – The answer is: Yes, it’s expected.\n",
      "But it’s also a chance for all you brides out there to truly show you know that not everything is about you on your wedding day. That there really is another person involved (that would be the groom) who deserves a bit of recognition, too.\n",
      "We’re talking wedding presents — specifically, yours to your husband-to-be.\n",
      "Tradition does, indeed, hold that both you and he exchange gifts. And while it’s true that some guys are initially shocked to learn your engagement ring doesn’t also count as a “present,” that’s no excuse for you to waver.\n",
      "“Giving him something that’s just for him will make him feel really special,” advises BrideBox.com.\n",
      "Here’s what you need to know now that it’s prime time for weddings:\n",
      "* When to exchange them. Etiquette dictates that the hand-off occurs at one of three times: the night before the wedding, the morning of the ceremony, or right before leaving on your honeymoon. Think it’s bad luck to see the groom before the nuptials? “Many couples choose to courier gifts via bridesmaids or groomsmen just before the ceremony,” says Brides.com.\n",
      "* There’s a thin line between “romantic” and “mushy.” Some of you may be tempted to compile a “love notes” journal of every bit of correspondence you’ve ever sent your groom. Even assuming he’s the type who wouldn’t consider that a bit “over the top,” there’s always the chance he might be left wondering, “Okay, where’s my real present?”– especially if his gift to you is a serious piece of jewelry.\n",
      "* The consensus choice. There’s a reason a watch invariably makes everyone’s short list: It’s the perfect statement of who he is or aspires to be. (It’s also a lot more impressive than a flask, which for some reason also gets a few votes).\n",
      "No less a taste arbiter than MarthaStewartWeddings.com favors Baume & Mercier’s Clifton line — as elegant as the original 1950s model that inspired it — for the way it “easily transitions from big day to every day.” Like the Swiss watchmaker’s timelessly charming (and affordably luxurious) Classima line, it comes with a choice of straps, dial faces and a variety of what’s known as “small complications” that go way beyong just telling the hour. You can shop them at the Baume & Mercier e-boutique or by calling 1-800-MERCIER, where free engraving and wrapping are available.\n",
      "* Fun fact. One writer at AskMen.com says he’s “heard of women giving their husbands watches in the ceremony instead of a wedding ring.” If so, the answer is: No, just like your engagement ring, that wouldn’t also qualify as a wedding present.Wedding Gifts for Grooms: A Tradition Brides Shouldn’t Ignore added by new_view_media on December 22, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Want to Increase Revenue? Take Your Business Global(NAPSI)—International selling may seem daunting, but thanks to the Internet, it’s more attainable than ever. With the right tools in place, small businesses can go global and increase revenues without the headache.The question then is, “Where should I sell?” Consider these two destinations as you map out your plan for international growth:CanadaCanadians are e-commerce enthusiasts—in fact, 60 percent of Canada’s online shoppers buy from U.S.-based sellers. As an added bonus, there’s typically no language barrier for U.S. businesses selling into Canada.Given this opportunity for U.S. small businesses, the U.S. Postal Service opted to create zone-based pricing for all Priority Mail International® shipments headed to Canada starting on May 31, 2015.This means that the USPS will charge for shipping based on the U.S. origin ZIP code and the Canada destination postal code, instead of blending expensive routes into one flat rate.There will now be seven pricing zones for shipping. Some rates will increase, but for businesses in major cities—such as San Francisco, Miami and Chicago—savings will be around $8 per package.BrazilLatin America is the world’s second-fastest-growing e-commerce market, and leading this boom is Brazil. With 202 million citizens, of whom 33.5 million shop online, Brazil presents a huge opportunity for U.S.-based businesses looking to expand, though it’s not without its challenges.Due to delays in customs clearance, postal packages could take up to 20 days to arrive. Duties and taxes, as well as complicated custom forms, slow the process for both U.S. merchants and the buyers.However, there are solutions. Shipping technology company Endicia just launched a program called Endicia Global Service, which allows shipments from U.S. businesses to reach Brazilian customers in as little as 8 days. Additionally, duties and taxes can be paid by the buyer up front, and there are no complicated customs forms to fill out.“International selling is a great way to grow a business and secure additional revenue,” said Endicia co-founder and general manager Amine Khechfé. “These markets in particular are undergoing massive growth, and there’s never been a better time for small businesses to look into them.”To learn about the tools you need to succeed in going global, check out www.endicia.com/go-global.Want to Increase Revenue?

      "(BPT) – Remember free time? You used to have so much of it. But these days, work and family obligations have you running around constantly and you don’t know what to do first. You don’t even have time to do everything you have to do, let alone what you want to do.So how do you take back your day? How do you find the time to get things done and bring back some semblance of order? It is possible if you focus on making yourself more efficient. To help you accomplish all of your goals and find some free time as well, here are four ways you can improve your efficiency every single day.* Make a plan. When you’re running through your list of daily obligations the morning of, it’s easy to forget a thing or two, especially if you have children running around, phones ringing or dogs barking to distract you. Instead, plan out the upcoming day the night before. Make a list of everything you have to do and check these items against one another. Can two trips be combined? Are you prioritizing the most important things first? The better you can plan out your schedule, the more organized you’ll be the next day.* Get the news and information you need ASAP. You are bombarded by digital content every day and some of it is really important – but who has time to sift through it all? To help you find the information you need as quickly as possible, Fresly LLC launched a new app, iNews Photo. Whether you are on the go, or gathering news in your office this application allows you access to global and local news curated in real time by former journalist directly to your mobile phone or on a larger screen.* Set priorities. You don’t have time to do it all and maybe you don’t have to. Sit down and make a list of every social or professional group and obligation you belong to. Once you’ve made the list, look at it and ask yourself honestly how important this obligation is to you or your family. If you find the obligation is not essential, you’re better off to abandon it and save your time for the responsibilities that are more important to you.* Limit multitasking. Many people look to multitasking as an efficiency solution, but doing several things at once means it takes longer to accomplish any one task. And when the first task is completed, the result is often poorer because of it. Instead of trying to do several things at once, focus on the most important thing, accomplish it and move on.With today’s hectic schedules, finding the opportunity to do everything you’re supposed to do may seem impossible. However, if you apply the four tips listed above, you’ll improve your efficiency, stay up on the latest news and maybe even discover that elusive free time you sorely deserve.

      "medical workers working together in hospital(BPT) – Over the last decade, a number of changes have transformed the healthcare industry. The Affordable Care Act has enabled more than 16.4 million Americans to receive healthcare coverage. Advancements in technology improve both diagnoses and treatment quality. Retail health offers a convenience used by more than 10 million patients at 1,800 retail health locations. Along with the current challenges facing the healthcare system, such as an aging population, increased patient volume and physician shortages, these changes prompt the expansion of the traditional role of a nurse.Generally, Americans believe nurses’ roles are expanding as they share increased responsibilities to support the delivery of high quality healthcare, according to a poll commissioned by University of Phoenix College of Health Professions. The survey also found that adults in the United States view their experience with nurses as overwhelmingly positive. In fact, 95 percent found nurses to be a valuable addition to the healthcare system as a whole, and 87 percent view nurses as trusted sources of health information.“As nurses take on greater responsibility, and as the needs of healthcare organizations continue to grow more complex, the skills and training requirements of nurses must be prepared to match this growth,” says Betty Nelson, Ph.D., RN, and academic dean for University of Phoenix School of Nursing. “This is especially important given that the United States is currently facing a shortage of as many as 90,000 physicians by 2025.. Nurses with advanced education can help fill this shortage, particularly in areas where consumers do not have access to care.”Because of this, employers are looking for nurses with a variety of skills and certifications including:* Additional degrees or seeking an advanced degree* In-demand skills such as bilingualism, leadership and critical thinking* Flexibility and professionalism* The desire to grow into advanced practitioners such as nurse practitioners and physician assistants* Specialized training for working with various populations* An openness to diverse opportunities in a number of different facilitiesIn order to keep up with the changes in the healthcare system, at least 80 percent of the nation’s nursing workforce will need a bachelor’s degree by 2020 and the number of nurses with doctoral degrees will need to be double, according to the Institute of Medicine. Nursing education institutions play a critical role in meeting the needs of today’s healthcare system. Nurses need a place to obtain these degrees and further their skills within the healthcare industry. Institutions recognize the expanding role of the 21st century nurse and are offering a wide range of curriculum and degree programs that address recent changes in the delivery of primary care. Graduates need to be equipped with the skills they need to succeed in today’s health care market.It’s now more important than ever that nurses have the training and skills to match the demands of the growing profession. Along with the nursing community, institutions that offer nursing degree programs must work together to enhance and better prepare the nursing workforce.What employers look for in the 21st century nurse added by new_view_media on November 15, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "(BPT) – What image does the word “grilling” bring to mind? Do you envision thick, juicy burgers or steaks? What about sauce-slathered chicken breasts sizzling over coals? Cooking out is one of the great joys of warm weather, but if you leave side dishes out of your grilling plans – or stick with cold sides like salads – you’re missing out on some great flavors.Side dishes give you a chance to really show off your grilling chops, savor the farm fresh flavors of summer harvests, and indulge in wholesome, organic fare. Here are six summer side dishes that go great on the grill:1. Corn on the cob – If you’ve always wanted to try grilling vegetables but weren’t sure which of your favorites would go well on the grill – take heart! Virtually any veggie can be prepared on a grill, but corn becomes a show-stopper when grilled. Remove the husks and silk and toss the cobs right on a preheated grill. Watch them careful and keep turning them to ensure they brown but don’t burn. The heat from the grill causes the natural sugars in the corn to carmelize, and you’ll end up with the sweetest sweet corn you ever tasted!2. Fries – A trip to the grocery store or farmer’s market for fresh produce may not fit in your schedule if you’re grilling on the fly. There’s good news – frozen options like Alexia Organic Oven Crinkles with Sea Saltdeliver farm to flavor taste when prepared on the grill or in the oven. Made from Pacific Northwest russet potatoes, Alexia’s organic fries are sprinkled with bright sea salt to bring out even more of the rich flavor that Mother Nature delivered. Make a tray out of aluminum foil, spread the Oven Crinkles in a single layer, and grill for about 20-25 minutes at 400-450 degrees F. Turn once or twice during the cooking process.3. Tomatoes – If you’ve only grilled small tomatoes on a kabob, or never tried grilled tomatoes at all, this is your summer to discover grilling tomatoes couldn’t be easier. Start with large, meaty tomatoes – a variety that’s dense and has fewer seeds works best. Slice in half, brush with your favorite seasoned oil and place the halves cut-side down on the grill. Cook for 3-5 minutes on each side. Top with your favorite cheese when done.4. Kale – Grilling greens like kale helps all those wonderful nutrients and flavor stay in the vegetable and don’t disappear into the cooking water – which is what can happen when you boil veggies on the stovetop. Grilling kale couldn’t be easier. You can adapt virtually any of your favorite kale recipes to grilling by tossing the kale with the recipe seasonings and some oil. Arrange the seasoned leaves in a single layer on the grill and they’ll cook to crispy splendor in just minutes.5. Cheese – A slice of gooey melted cheese is the crowning glory atop your grilled burger, but cheese can also handle the grill on its own, and be a delicious, different side dish or appetizer. Many cheeses will work on the grill, and you can find recommendations for the best cheeses to cook on the grill with a simple online search. Slice your chosen cheese in thick pieces. Most grilling cheeses will need minimal seasoning and little or no oil. Generally, cheese takes just a minute or two to brown each side and allow the inside to melt.6. Dinner rolls – Craving dinner rolls to go with that thick juicy steak, but in no mood to fire up the oven when it’s 90 degrees outside? You can make frozen dinner rolls on the grill. Choose your favorite variety, such as Alexia Artisan French Rolls or Artisan Focaccia Rolls, set your gas grill to the temperature recommended on the package’s directions, wrap the rolls in foil and place directly on the grill. Keep an eye on the rolls to ensure they don’t burn as they can cook quickly on a grill.6 summer sides you never knew you could grill added by new_view_media on April 3, 2016View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "(BPT) – Traditional wedding rules have fallen by the wayside – food trucks are in, having a hashtag is a must, bridesmaids no longer wear the same dress and groomsmen are sometimes in sneakers. Couples are actively seeking ways to differentiate themselves and get creative. All that aside, there is one thing that remains constant – weddings must have wine.Without wine, there is no glass to raise during the toast to the bride and groom and nothing to drink when the bar closes during dinner. Wine is the first thing guests are offered when they take a seat, and – you know that they say – it’s important to make a good first impression.Choosing the right varietals for your wedding does not have to be a stressful endeavor. Whether you’re a novice wine drinker or a connoisseur, follow these four tips and you’ll please a crowd without spending a fortune:Say “cheers!” with a sparkling wine.People love a good toast, and nothing washes down a teary maid of honor speech like a glass of sparkling. Riondo Prosecco is an accessible option that’s ideal to enjoy any day of the year, but perfectly suited for special occasions. You’ll get six pours out of a bottle, so plan accordingly!Good things come in threes.In addition to a sparkling, you’ll want a red and a white option that are familiar and food-friendly. You can’t go wrong with a Merlot – look for labels from the Napa region. For a white, Terlato Friuli Pinot Grigio is exceptional and ideal for food pairing.Wine math: What you didn’t learn in school.Running out of wine mid-wedding isn’t an option, so it’s important to do the math. You should anticipate getting about 5 glasses per bottle and assume that each guest will drink one glass per hour. Follow this rule and the wine will flow all night long, keeping you and your guests happy.Don’t break the bank, but stay away from the cheap stuff.Choosing an excellent wine doesn’t mean paying top-dollar, but buying too cheap can mean sacrificing quality. There are countless high-quality, delicious, wines available for $10-$20 per bottle, so leave the cheap stuff on the bottom shelf!4 wine buying tips for weddings added by new_view_media on April 3, 2016View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "(BPT) – Around-the-clock food shows, celebrity guests and niche themed restaurants are just a few reasons the fine food movement continues to experience extraordinary growth. In 2016, more people will be seeking upscale dining experiences that focus on the unique to the luxurious — and they’re willing to pay big bucks to do so.In fact, Americans said they would splurge an average of $203 in order to have a once-in-a-lifetime dining experience at a gourmet restaurant, according to a recent online survey by Harris Poll sponsored byMichelin, the global tire maker that publishes the popular restaurant guide.What’s surprising is the people willing to pay the most for fine dining experiences are younger generations. Millennials (ages 18-34) on average would pay $282 for this culinary experience, compared to diners ages 45-54 who would shell out $170, and $122 for those 65 and older.One explanation for why younger diners are willing to pay so much is that they want to enjoy more than just fine cuisine. Many restaurants offer an overall experience that will be remembered long after the last morsel of food is gone. Whether it’s an incredible atmosphere, the opportunity to observe the chef work or gaining access to foods and cooking styles never available before, this desire for an experience is driving younger diners to invest in upscale dining.As America looks at the most recent Michelin star ratings to navigate the nation’s best eateries, there are some food and restaurant trends that are positioned to grow in 2016. Chefs will continue to expand their creative prowess by experimenting with new cooking styles and food fusions. Cooking methods will blend with science and art to create uniquely fine fare with a story that is as intriguing as the taste.Diversity is another notable trend for 2016. Authentic ethnic cuisine is in high demand and restaurants are answering the call. Traditional restaurants will begin to offer diverse plates in addition to timeless favorites to appeal to a wide range of palates. Expect to see more ancient grains, ethnic spices and worldly condiments at eateries in the future.Conscious dining is a growing trend thanks to diners’ increasing awareness of where their food comes from. Hyper-local sourcing of ingredients is being adopted by many notable restaurants. This includes growing fresh herbs and vegetables onsite and partnering with local farms for incredibly fresh dairy and meat products. Sustainable seafood partnerships are another effort by restaurants that supports the increasing demand for responsible dining options.Finally, diners are seeking chefs with the best reputation for tried-and-true favorites. That means the city’s chef with a reputation for curating and cooking the best steak will have a wait list. Supporting this nod toward the traditional, the Michelin survey found a quarter of U.S. adults say steakhouse cuisine is their favorite choice for dining. What’s the runner up? Italian ranked as the second choice nationally for the meal of a lifetime.Which 2016 dining trend do you want to try most? added by new_view_media on April 3, 2016View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Be Well Tressed Every Day With Wigs(NAPSI)—Changing your hair to suit your hat, your mood or your outfit-or to make holidays and other celebrations that much more special—can be easier and more fun than ever.TV Star’s IdeaExplains Daytime Emmy Award winner Sherri Shepherd, “When I was a little girl, I would hear all this commotion in my house from my mom, aunts and grandmother when picking out their wigs for the day. It was such a good time for them and was a major part of their everyday beauty routines. Ever since then, I’ve watched the women in my household glow with confidence because they would customize their look day by day through the use of faux hair. My grandmother had a wig that she would pick out and wear perfectly with specific hats. My mother had an Angela Davis ‘power to the people’ wig. Watching these iconic women in my life pair their hair lengths, styles and colors with particular hats, outfits and personalities was exciting. Getting ready to go out was like an event in and of itself. Wigs are the perfect way for the inner diva in all women to come out and get creative, which is why I was inspired to start my own wig line to give women the choices to create their own style and look.“I always say, you were born with the hair you’ve got—now get the hair you want. Short and sassy, long and sexy or curly and fierce; you can easily change your hairstyle and transform your whole look to fit whatever your day brings.

      "On National Senior Citizens Day, Three Ways To Celebrate The Older Generation(NAPSI)—Whether it’s your parents, grandparents, aunt, uncle or neighbor, you likely received guidance from or looked to older people in your life as you’ve tried to become more independent and deal with change and everyday challenges. August 21 is National Senior Citizens Day, and it’s an ideal time to honor seniors for the wisdom and care they have provided us, and also to celebrate the members of the older generation by finding ways to enhance their lives as they age.There’s No Place Like HomeNearly 90 percent of seniors want to age in place—stay in their own homes as they get older. But one out of three seniors suffers a fall each year, according to the CDC. Making an older person’s home as safe as possible is integral to helping him or her maintain this independence. Walking through seniors’ daily routine with them, from the time they get out of bed to when they go back to sleep, can reveal patterns in how they navigate their home and any potential hazards. By identifying the areas of concern and making necessary adjustments, you can decrease the risk of an accident and seniors can reside more confidently in their own home.Stay ConnectedTechnology now allows grandparents to FaceTime their children and grandchildren across the globe or even in the next town, and seniors to reconnect with classmates of decades past via Facebook. Older generations can create, build and maintain quality social relationships with the convenience and ease of social media. Seniors have a multitude of online outlets to share updates, photos and videos with loved ones. To help them stay in touch, ensure that the seniors in your life have reliable Internet connectivity, and help them set up social media accounts if they don’t have one already. In-person interaction is ideal, but keeping in touch through computers, tablets and smartphones is a great way to supplement seeing and speaking with each other.Everyone’s Wearing TechnologyWearable technology like the Apple Watch is popular among younger audiences, but wearable fitness trackers and medical alert devices can provide great benefits to seniors as well. In the event of a fall or accident where it’s impossible to get to a phone to call for help, a medical alert device immediately connects the injured to emergency services. Because that person’s medical history and health needs are on file, first responders can more easily treat them. With help a push of a button away, medical alert devices give seniors peace of mind even beyond health concerns. In fact, a recent survey by Bay Alarm Medical found that 80 percent of medical alert device wearers worry less when their adult children travel because they feel the device provides an adequate support system. If you decide to help protect the senior in your life with a wearable medical alert system, it’s also wise to look for a caring, people-first, ethical provider. Bay Alarm Medical, for example, implemented a Code of Ethics it follows for uncompromisingly ethical and transparent business practices. The company vows to prioritize customers over sales, make pricing publicly accessible and never pressure customers into a product or service they do not need, among other safeguards.National Senior Citizens Day is a day to commemorate the great ways in which seniors have helped us and we should show them how thankful we are every day. Simple steps such as a home safety walk-through, staying connected and providing the tools to enhance their physical and emotional well-being can go a long way in reducing the stress of aging for seniors and their loved ones.On National Senior Citizens Day, Three Ways To Celebrate The Older Generation added by new_view_media on December 24, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Don’t Let The Flu Mean Missing Memorable Moments(NAPSI)—While the cold and flu season often coincides with holiday celebrations and family get-togethers, there are preventative measures that families can take to stay healthy and not miss out.To help you get to the next “can’t miss” life event, consider these top preventative tips:• Get an annual flu shot. It’s the most effective way to help prevent the spread of influenza. For your convenience, you can get a vaccine at any of the more than 7,800 CVS/pharmacy and 900 MinuteClinic locations across the country. The flu shot is available every day with no appointment needed, including evenings and weekends.As a preventive service under the Affordable Care Act, it’s fully covered and available at no cost through most insurance plans, including Medicare Part B.The pharmacy can also be a one-stop shop for flu prevention resources, including over-the-counter cold and flu remedies, multivitamins and anti-bacterial cleaning products. Plus, anyone enrolled in the ExtraCare Rewards program gets a 20 percent off CVS Shopping Pass upon getting the flu shot in most places.• Seniors, take extra precaution. There’s a high-dose flu shot designed for those 65 and older, who have a greater risk of severe illness from the flu.• Plan ahead: the earlier, the better. It takes up to two weeks for your immunity to build up after getting a flu shot. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone who is at least 6 months old get a flu shot as soon as the vaccine is available.• Stay home if you’re ill. While it may seem like a no-brainer, two-thirds of employed Americans would still go to work even if they were feeling ill with flu-like symptoms. It’s important to understand the preliminary symptoms of the flu and, if you experience them, to stay home. This will help bolster your immune system and prevent the germs spreading.• Practice healthy habits. Door handles, desks and other everyday items are ridden with germs. Wash your hands frequently with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds and avoid touching your mouth and eyes. Additionally, eat nutritious foods, drink plenty of water, and get sufficient sleep to keep your immune system in top shape. Lead by example to educate children about these habits.Learn MoreFor further information and to find a nearby store, visit www.cvs.com/flu or download the CVS/pharmacy mobile app.Don’t Let The Flu Mean Missing Memorable Moments added by new_view_media on December 24, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Medicare Open Enrollment: What You Need To Knowby Patricia Smith(NAPSI)—Every year, millions of Medicare beneficiaries must decide which Medicare Advantage (MA) plan will best serve their needs. During Medicare’s annual open enrollment period, October 15-December 7, you can change MA plans or enroll in one for the first time. Important factors to consider include premium costs, choice of doctors and plan benefits. But there is one other important question: What is the quality rating of the plan?Quality is important because it means better health care and the best value for your money. Medicare uses a system called Star Ratings to assess the quality of plans, awarding plans from one to five stars. These ratings are based on many factors, such as how well the plan does in keeping people healthy and preventing illness, how quickly you can get an appointment and see specialists, and how the plan responds to your complaints and concerns.Today, 65 percent of MA enrollees are in plans with four stars or more, compared to 17 percent in 2009. Eight of the 12 MA plans earning five stars this year are members of the Alliance of Community Health Plans, an organization representing high-quality health plans.You can learn more about MA plans using the Medicare Plan Finder at www.Medicare.gov. The National Committee for Quality Assurance also evaluates quality in MA plans at www.ncqa.org.• Ms. Smith is the president and CEO of the Alliance of Community Health Plans, www.achp.org.Medicare Open Enrollment: What You Need To Know added by new_view_media on December 24, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "How To Plan A Smooth Group Ski Trip(NAPSI)—According to a study from Wyndham Vacation Rentals, most travelers take ski and snowboard vacations in groups of four or more. Hitting the slopes with a big group doesn’t have to be hard, even when it comes to coordinating everyone’s schedules and travel arrangements.Group Ski Trip TipsWhile it can be challenging to keep everyone happy during the vacation, these planning hints can help get everyone started on the right foot.• Find the right lodging. When traveling with a larger group, alternative lodging options might be your best bet. A cabin, condo or home lets everyone stay together under one roof without sacrificing privacy. Everyone can have his or her own bedroom, while common spaces such as a living room or dining room make spending time together easy. Most rental homes also feature a kitchen, which can cut down on the stress of dining out as a large group. Have everyone take a night to prepare dinner. You’ll not only save money, you’ll enjoy time together without the interruptions of a busy restaurant.• Plan for transportation. When researching lodging, see if your accommodations rest along a community shuttle route or offer their own shuttle services. Also look into the destination’s transit systems. Sun Valley, for example, offers free bus service. If you’re renting a car, make sure you plan for times when the group splits up. Leaving half the group stranded won’t make for a fun situation.• Agree on activities beforehand. While skiing and snowboarding may be the top priorities, there are plenty of other activities to do during a ski trip. From dogsledding and snow tubing to unique local festivals, you might find attractions you just don’t want to miss. Have everyone weigh in on top choices before the trip, especially those who are attending but who aren’t avid skiers or snowboarders. Considering everyone’s preferences in advance can help reduce stress during the trip itself.• Give everyone some downtime. Opinions often differ, especially within larger groups, so allow for flexibility during the trip. If your muscles are begging for a break, read a book or squeeze in a post-run nap while your fellow travelers stay on the slopes. If half of the group wants to head downtown for the afternoon while the other half wants to get in another mountain activity, split up for a few hours. By staying flexible with the group’s itinerary, you’ll avoid any tension and better enjoy the time you all spend together.Learn MoreTo start your planning now, you can visit www.WyndhamVacationRentals.com for deals on vacation rental homes in some of North America’s top ski destinations.How To Plan A Smooth Group Ski Trip added by new_view_media on December 22, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Triple Sorghum Granola(Family Features) As you look to the new year with plans for healthier habits, there’s no better place to start than the beginning – the beginning of each day, that is. Countless studies have shown the benefits of a nutritious breakfast as part of a healthy eating plan, and there are plenty of options to make a good-for-you breakfast that tastes great, too.Experts agree that there are numerous health benefits to breakfast. For example, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics credits breakfast with helping brain function and memory as well as preventing tiredness and overeating as the day wears on. Mayo Clinic staff adds that adults who eat breakfast are likely to consume more vitamins and minerals, and less fats and cholesterol.Wake up your morning routine with these tips for a healthier start to each day:Plan a well-rounded meal. Incorporate whole grains, like sorghum, lean protein, low-fat dairy and fruits and vegetables, for a nutrient-rich meal that will keep you fueled and feeling full until lunch time.Experiment with new flavors. Avoid burnout and boredom by trying new foods. For example, substitute your typical grain with sorghum, an American-grown cereal grain. In addition to its delicious flavor, sorghum is a highly versatile ingredient that is naturally high in fiber, iron and protein and can be used in a wide range of preparations.Eliminate obstacles. If hectic mornings are preventing you from getting a healthy breakfast, find solutions that work for you and your family.

      " The Morris County Board of Freeholders invites the public to join them in observing the 14th anniversary of 9/11 at a Remembrance Service and Candlelight Vigil on Sun., Sept. 13.The ceremony will begin at 5 p.m. at the Morris County September 11th Memorial on West Hanover Avenue in Parsippany-Troy Hills, across from the Morris View Healthcare Center and adjacent to the Morris County Public Safety Academy.The event will include a march with a color guard up West Hanover Avenue to the Memorial by police, fire, rescue and emergency personnel from across Morris County.The observance will include a special invocation, a lighting of candles, and reading of the names of each of the Morris County victims, plus a 21-gun salute, and keynote remarks.Elizabeth Schrier, the widow of the late Freeholder Jack Schrier, who was instrumental in getting Morris County’s 9/11 Memorial constructed, will carry the American flag during the ceremony.Morris County’s September 11th Memorial pays tribute to all of those who died in the terrorist attacks in New York, Pennsylvania and Washington D.C., on Sept. 11, 2001, with a special emphasis on the 64 victims from Morris County whose names are etched in plaques that are affixed to the Memorial.The names of all of the nearly 3,000 people who died that day are engraved in ruby-colored paving stones that have been set in the ground as a walkway surrounding the Memorial.“It is vitally important to gather each year on the anniversary of 9/11 to recall every single one of the nearly 3,000 people who were tragically lost to us on that day, including 64 of our Morris County residents,’’ said Freeholder Director Kathy DeFillippo. “Their families and friends should know that the lives of their loved ones will never be forgotten.’’Since seating at the Memorial is limited, the public is encouraged to bring lawn chairs to the outdoor observance. Parking will be available at the Morris County Department of Human Services building at 340 West Hanover Ave., in Morris Township – across from the Academy. Shuttle buses will be available to transport those in need to the Memorial.The freeholders also invite police and fire departments and rescue squads from across the county to participate by sending one apparatus per department and assembling at 6 p.m. at the Morris County Public Safety Academy, 500 West Hanover Ave., in Parsippany-Troy Hills. From there, a procession will be held to the Sept. 11th Memorial.More information can be obtained by calling 973-285-6400, 973-829-8120 or 973-829-8200.          Morris County To Hold Memorial Service 5 p.m. added by new_view_media on September 1, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "St. Virgil Group Helps Keep Morris Plains Cleaner And Litter FreeAs the weather gets warmer, groups will be spreading out across Morris Plains to pick up litter and recyclables that have been carelessly tossed along roadways and in parks. The first to participate this year were a group of twelve students from St. Virgil.\n",
      "The St. Virgil group uses their mini grant money to help fund their yearly trip to Appalachia to help do work in this very depressed area. Along with two adults the young people were out on a chilly and drizzly first weekend in April to scour Simones Park. They picked up seven large bags of trash and two large bags of recyclables.\n",
      "Simones Park, at the end of Mountain Way, has been adopted by the sixth grade students from Borough School that have pledged to go out and clean the park four times a year. But Simones Park is a problem area. Even with the Borough School group, extra clean-ups, like this one by St. Virgil, and the help of neighbors that live across the street, litter is a consistent problem. Banners in the park with the litter program logo “Pick Up Morris Plains – Keep Us Litter Free” as a reminder to visitors have helped, but not enough.\n",
      "Litter is unhealthy, unsightly, and can be a safety hazard. Simones Park not only has soccer fields and open areas, but also has a well-used playground, so that broken bottles and crushed cans could lead to injuries.\n",
      "Anyone can help stop litter by using the many recycling containers and trash cans placed throughout the parks, as well as all along the main street, Speedwell Avenue. There is also a recycling container placed across the street from the train station. But even more important, the attitude that causes people to litter must be changed. People tend to think that somebody else will clean up litter left in the street or on the sidewalk, especially in places where there already is a lot of litter or places where the sense of community pride is low.\n",
      "Morris Plains wants everyone to take responsibility for their actions and pride in the environment and the town – don’t litter, put trash and recyclables in their proper place!\n",
      "Morris Plains Councilman John “Jack” Doherty is the liaison to the Clean Communities and Recycling programs and he commended the mini grant groups saying, “We are pleased that so many groups come out during the year to help with litter pickups, but hope our residents will keep our town a “community of caring” and do their part.”\n",
      "The groups that participate receive grant funds from the State Clean Communities Program. Penny Manser is head of the Youth Ministry at St. Virgil and said that, “The mission trip we take each summer is ten days of working with the people of Harlan, Kentucky, the 18th poorest county in the United States. The families there are picked by lottery for help with roofing, plumbing, painting, ditch digging, sheet rock work, siding, clean up from floods or whatever is needed by these local families. It is our opportunity to truly work as disciples in the world, and to learn to be grateful for the gifts that we have.”\n",

      "Morris Arts recently opened a 15th exhibit, entitled Black, White and Green at the Gallery in Morristown.  Guest curator Katherine Murdock, the Exhibition Committee of Morris Arts and the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation selected works by several outstanding artists in New Jersey and New York.\n",
      "Inspired by the biowall, the vertical garden of living plants within the exhibit space, Murdock chose to focus the exhibit on plants and selected the title, Black, White and Green, to purposefully reflect that limited color palette as a means of unifying the exhibit. What is striking, however, is the richness and variety of the artists’ unique approaches to the theme – through their use of different media (collage, oil, cold wax painting, photography, charcoal drawings, wood sculpture, etc.), composition, and subtle gradations of color.As Murdock notes, “Casey Ruble’s paper collage illustrates a bundled bouquet of invasive plant species and Kathy Cantwell’s oil and cold wax on panel explores green color fields that resemble landscape. Richard Bottwin uses plant material as a medium and highlights the wood grain with stain and paint.”The public is invited to view this exciting exhibit, open Mon.-Fri. from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and by appointment, and will remain on display until Aug. 24.  Visit www.morrisarts.org<https://www.morrisarts.org or call 973- 285-5115 for additional information.Morris Arts located in Morristown is a not-for-profit organization founded in 1973 dedicated to building community through the artsBlack, White, Green Art Exhibit Featured In Gallery added by new_view_media on March 19, 2016View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "On Sun., Sept. 13 Macculloch Hall Historical Museum welcomes Linda J. Barth from the Canal Society of New Jersey (CSNJ) Barth will present a program about The Delaware and Raritan Canal (D&R). The D&R is one of the subjects of the current second floor gallery exhibit “Canals of New Jersey” which will be available to view prior to the presentation.Canal author and historian Linda J. Barth will introduce the people, the bridges, the locks, and the aqueducts that made D&R Canal work. This waterway, now a “greenway” and the centerpiece of a popular state park, transported men and supplies between New York and Philadelphia during three wars. Inventor John Holland used the canal to deliver his Holland VI submarine to Washington for its Navy trials, and luxury yachts, like J .P. Morgan’s Tarantula, cruised the waterway.For more than 170 years, the D&R Canal has meandered across the narrow waist of New Jersey and was one of the nation’s most successful towpath canals, carrying more tonnage in 1866 than the more famous Erie Canal. Johnson & Johnson, Roebling, and Fleischmann’s Distillery all had their start along the D&R. These days the canal provides the people of central New Jersey with both a water supply and a premier recreational facility. Today, the Morris Canal Greenway, a partnership between local communities and the Canal Society of New Jersey, seeks to preserve the surviving historic remains of the canal, interpret canal sites, and offer recreational opportunities to the public. In this presentation Linda will discuss the history and operation of the canal and how it is used today.MHHM opens at 1 p.m. on Sept. 13 and visitors who arrive prior to the 4:30 p.m. program can enjoy the “Canals of New Jersey” exhibit. MHHM has partnered with CSNJ to present this display of panels that tell the story of New Jersey’s two towpath canals, the Morris and the Delaware and Raritan. The CSNJ’s display is supplemented by objects including some from MHHM’s collection and information about Macculloch Hall founder George Macculloch who had the idea for the Morris Canal. The exhibit shares some of the stories of the workers and families who lived and worked on the canal, as well as other details about its construction using photographs and drawings, as well objects such as model canal boats.Tickets for the program go on sale from 1 p.m., no advance sales, and remain on sale until the presentation begins at 4:30 p.m. Speaker tickets include admission to the museum exhibits during the afternoon and a guided tour of period rooms, the last tour ticket is sold at 3 p.m. Speaker tickets will remain on sale until 4:30 p.m.The Museum’s second floor “The Civil War Through the Eyes of Thomas Nast” and “Canals of New Jersey” exhibits will remain on view until 4:30 p.m. The first floor “Thomas Nast: Unknown Works and American Icons” exhibit will close 3:30 p.m. – 4 p.m. in preparation for the program. Tickets to hear speakers are Adults $8; Seniors & Students $6; Children 6 – 12 $4. Members and children under 5 are admitted free.For more information call Karen Hollywood, Publicity and Programs Coordinator Macculloch Hall Historical Museum at (973) 538-2404 ext. 15.Linda Barth To Speak At MHHM added by new_view_media on August 16, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Locals Volunteer To Build A Better Life In GuatemalaBy Cheryl ConwayBeyond the conditions many can relate to, outside the walls of what’s the norm, exists a world so difficult to imagine unless one visits and reaches out to help.In Guatemala City, 11,000 people- in which 7,000 are kids- live and work inside a garbage dump.“Most survive by picking through the trash to earn less than five dollars a day. Many find their daily food in the dump.”Just when all hopelessness is lost for these human beings living in one of the most impoverished areas , more and more volunteers are stepping up to assist and steer them to a better life. Some local people have become very involved and formed an organization known as Beyond The Walls. This month, 75 individuals are volunteering to visit the Guatemala City Garbage Dump to build houses, donate clothing and shoes and organize sport clinics.The non-profit organization started in 2007 at the Mendham Hills Community Church, although mission teams were sent out before.“We had been going to Guatemala for a couple of years,” explains Betsy Ahl of Morris Township, executive director of Beyond The Walls. “The church was sending mission teams. We asked volunteers to help raise money to help pay for trips, build houses. They’d raise more money and that would go toward projects.”In order to influence others outside the church to get involved, and to receive matching grants from volunteers’ employers, organizers decided to expand the church group to a secular, non-profit organization, explains Ahl.The idea to help the people of Guatemala dates back to 2005, when Mendham was named one of the top wealthiest places to live in America.“The elders of Mendham Hills Chapel thought this wasn’t how others lived,” explains Ahl, “so they asked the chairman of the missions’ team to find an area that needed help.”One of the poorest places in the world, the Guatemala City Garbage Dump, was identified by a church member and the idea to team up with the Potter’s House organization, with a mission to eradicate poverty, build houses, help others get business loans and establish community programs.“It’s a ravine right in the center of the Capitol City,” describes Ahl. “They’ve been filling it up with garbage for 50 years.”In their first mission, Ahl joined 26 others for four days. The group, after that, “could have gone to Africa one year, China one year,” but the group decided it was more important to “come back and form long term relationships,” says Ahl who has sponsored three kids in Guatemala in the Kids In Potter House Education Program, in which 50 kids are sponsored to receive an education. Ahl has been sponsoring these kids since they were in the first grade, are now graduating high school and will be supported through college.Church member and organization volunteer, Mike Rubright, 50, of Long Valley, is currently on one of three missions to Guatemala this month through Beyond The Walls. His ninth trip out there during the past seven years, Rubright and his daughter, Erin, are working in the garbage dump from July 18-25.Another one of his daughters, Emily, has gone on the trip seven times but had to miss this one. Youth volunteers must be starting atleast seventh grade to participate, so for Erin this is her third trip. Volunteers must contribute $1,600 each in order to participate, with funds going toward flight and lodging; and additional funds to supplies and building houses. Every year, Rubright sends letters and emails to friends requesting donations to help support his volunteer work.About 75 people have signed up through Beyond The Walls to volunteer during the three missions this month, with 10 people from the Mendham, Long Valley and Chester areas. The others are from areas throughout the country such as Florida, New York and Texas, who formed their own groups with Beyond The Walls.Rubright and his wife, Katie, have a niece who was adopted from Guatemala so their connection is even greater.“I do construction all day long,” says Rubright. “I had no idea what I was doing; I had no construction experience. Now I’m the person in charge of construction projects my week.“Everybody builds, everybody works; it doesn’t matter how old you are,” says Rubright, principal at the Woodglen Middle School in Lebanon Twp.“We build a concrete block house with a concrete floor,” he explains. “We mix concrete by hand; it’s the hardest thing I’ve ever done. The girls and women work harder than I’ve ever seen; they don’t stop.” A family that is getting a house built works beside the volunteers.“It’s not very big,” he says, with the homes about 15 feet by 15 feet,” the size of a bedroom. Homes are for four to five person families, and sometimes six to eight people.It’s like “nine people living in the size of your kitchen,” describes Ahl. Homes are built side by side and cost $5,600 to build.A completed house consists of one big room with one eight-foot partition wall that separates the bedrooms from “everything else,” says Rubright. “They have a toilet and a shower stall” in an area about the size of a closet, and they get “a big concrete sink” that can weigh up to 600 pounds, which is used for all washing needs such as dishes and clothes.Rubright also works under Guatemala masons who are very particular with how they want things to be completed, he says.“They tell us what to do,” says Rubright. “There are a lot of times we do things that don’t make sense; you can’t tell them they are wrong. That’s frustrating. If they tell you to put a hole in a concrete pipe with a hammer and nails, instead of a drill, you do it.”The homes that are being built for the people in the Guatemala City Garbage Dump is luxury compared to the “cardboard sheet metal,” dirt, chemicals, methane gas that surround them and sicken them while living in the dump and “breathing the trash.”These houses also provide shelter and protection for these people, says Rubright, as gun shots are commonly fired in the garbage dump.His goal during this one week visit is to build three to five houses with his group of volunteers.Potter’s House has built 110 homes to date, with 75 contributed by the volunteers of Beyond The Walls, says Ahl, who visits four times, about six weeks a year.In addition to building homes, the volunteers lead soccer clinics and donate uniforms, soccer balls and cleats as well as baseball clinics and donations of t-shirts; help at a medical clinic, vacation Bible school, and deliver groceries and visit families.Through their efforts, much progress has been made such as concrete roads, a community center built last year, education programs which is much needed as the average kid does not go past fifth grade in Guatemala, says Rubright.“A lot of families look at education as not important,” says Rubright. “A lot end up working in the garbage dump” as scavengers. “They make money picking out recyclables. People sift through trash looking through recyclables to see what they can sell” or “they are looking for food to eat it.” Parents stop sending their kids to school because they need their school age kids to watch younger siblings so parents can work.If they are not scavengers, they rely on the garbage dump to sell their own goods, like tortillas to the scavengers so they can eat, and even jewelry, says Ahl.“It’s just this culture of poverty,” says Ahl, with high unemployment. “Education is not a value, that’s the bottom line. Potter’s House tries to teach the value of education especially to the parents.” It also tries to teach the vendors who do sell inside the garbage dump to sell on the outside, says Ahl.“But without education, it’s really, really hard to move their way out of the dump,” says Ahl.Scavengers are even making less these days. As the economy declined, so did the value of recyclables, explains Rubright. For those working 10 to 12 hour days, they are making two to three dollars.While “there are guns everywhere, “Rubright admits that he feels safe when there.“The organization we are with is well respected,” he says, and they stay in a retreat center with accommodations like that of a motel or college dorm. “We are safe; every store has an armed guard,” and no one walks alone. “We have relationships with people. We go to the same neighborhoods. There’s more of a comfort level now. It’s a safe place- I bring my kids there I’m not in fear of our lives.”It is the desire to help others and the appreciation that brings Rubright back to the dump.He says, “If there’s really a God, why does he let that happen? We let it happen by not choosing to use our resources that way. I don’t think I could not go back. They have so little but they appreciate everything they have. We have so much and we want so much more.”They say, “This morning I lived in a garbage dump; now I live in a mansion.”Rubright admits, “I’ve learned more from them than they get from me. I’m a better person in Guatemala than I am here.”Also nice is the community bond shared by the volunteers.For the last five or six years, the same group of people have been volunteering. “Everyone enjoys each other’s company,” say Rubright. “We work hard all day, you come back eat dinner. There’s community; there’s no television, little internet, no cell services. It’s a lot what life should be like.”Like Ahl, the Rubrights have sponsored a girl there since she was eight; now she is 17. Through their support they have helped Jennifer Lopez Munoz continue to go to school and get an education.Rubright tells people, “I have three daughters in America and one in Guatemala.”“All the kids down there, they know when we come back,” says Rubright. “It’s humbling; it’s like family.” Volunteers bring with them bags of clothing and shoes for more than 200 kids.Beyond the Walls has helped other communities outside of Guatemala, such as Native Americans, homeless people in Dover and in Newark.Rubright plans to volunteer at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota next, which is known as the poorest place in the U.S., next to Haiti, from alcoholism and unemployment faced by Native Americans. “This was their country and they are at the bottom of the ladder.”Beyond the Walls is always seeking more volunteers, contributions for clothing and shoes, and financial support.Its next mission to the garbage dump is Oct. 24-31, with already 20 people signed up.Go to Beyondthewalls.org for more information. To volunteer, email gobeyomdthewalls@gmail.com.“I encourage people to go, go somewhere,” says Rubright, Long Valley softball coach for the past 14 years and former school board member. “Find something to do where you can do something for someone else. There are people everywhere who need something. You do not need to be religious. Some people think it’s a church thing – it’s people helping other people.”Locals Volunteer To Build A Better Life In Guatemala added by new_view_media on August 18, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "An Evening with The Monkees\n",
      "Featuring Micky Dolenz and Peter TorkThursday, August 27 at 8 pm(Morristown) – Hey, hey it’s The Monkees, featuring Micky Dolenz and Peter Tork, coming to Mayo Performing Arts Center on Thursday, August 27, 2015 at 8 pm. Tickets are $49-99.When four young men were cast in the television roles of a struggling rock band inspired by The Beatles’ A Hard Day’s Night, few could have predicted the impact The Monkees would make on music and pop culture at large, an impact that still reverberates 50 years later.Assembled in Los Angeles in 1965 by Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider for the television series The Monkees, the quartet of Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith, Peter Tork, and the late Davy Jones brought a singular mix of pop, rock, psychedelica, Broadway, and country to their music. The show itself, meanwhile, paid tribute not only to The Beatles, but also to the comedy stylings of The Marx Brothers and Laurel and Hardy as well as the pop-art sensibilities of Warhol and the emerging San Francisco psychedelic scene.The Monkees’ first single, “Last Train to Clarksville,” was released in August 1966, hitting #1 and serving as advance publicity for their series, which debuted on September 12. When the group’s self-titled debut album arrived in stores a month later, it quickly headed for the top spot of the Billboard charts, where it would ultimately sit for 13 of the 78 weeks it remained in the Top 200. (Two decades later, in the midst of a new burst of Monkee-mania, The Monkees popped back onto the charts, bringing the total number of weeks to 102.)By the time the group’s TV series aired its final new episode on March 25, 1968, the Monkees had seen three further albums top the charts – More of the Monkees, Headquarters, and Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones, Ltd., all of which were released in 1967, staggeringly enough – while racking up several more hit singles, with “I’m a Believer,” “(I’m Not Your) Steppin’ Stone,” “A Little Bit Me, A Little Bit You,” “The Girl I Knew Somewhere,” “Pleasant Valley Sunday,” “Words,”  “Daydream Believer,” “Valleri,” and “Tapioca Tundra” all finding their way into the Billboard Top 40.After the series’ two-season run, the group went on to star in the cult feature film HEAD (co-written by Jack Nicholson) and a TV special (33 1/3 Revolutions per Monkee) while also continuing to record new material, but much as the ’60s gave way to the ’70s, the members of the Monkees eventually gave in to their individual musical interests and went their separate ways. for awhile.In February 1986, after MTV broadcast a marathon of The Monkees, Dolenz, Jones, and Tork reunited for a 20th anniversary tour, with Nesmith joining them onstage for the Los Angeles date of the tour, and in 1996, all four members of the group reunited for a new album (Justus) and TV special (Hey, Hey, It’s the Monkees).In the wake of Jones’s death on February 29, 2012, the surviving members of the Monkees reunited and performed a series of concerts. The shows were greeted with sell-out response and phenomenal reviews. Now, Micky Dolenz and Peter Tork carry on that tradition with a full evening of magic music and multi-media splendor, including clips from their Emmy Award winning series. Their new show features all of the Monkees hits, plus an intimate acoustic set and solo spots for each of the singers. An Evening With The Monkees is sure to please every fan of the band.Mayo Performing Arts Center, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, presents a wide range of programs that entertain, enrich, and educate the diverse population of the region and enhance the economic vitality of Northern New Jersey. The 2015-2016 season is made possible, in part, by a grant the New Jersey State Council on the Arts/Department of State, a Partner Agency of the National Endowment for the Arts, as well as support received from the Geraldine R.

      "By Steve SearsThe New Jersey State Federation of Women’s Clubs of GFWC (General Federation of Women’s Clubs) has quite a past. 125 years to be exact.But, what this large group of Garden State women are doing now to better the current and pave the path for the future ensures another 125 years and more.Originally founded in 1894, the NJSFWC at one time had more than 40,000 members. There are approximately 6,500 current members, with 184 clubs statewide. Mary Wolfe, a member of the Woman’s Club of Vineland, is also current state President. “The purpose, as it says in our Mission Statement, is to provide opportunities for education, leadership training, and community service through participation in local clubs, enabling members to make a difference in the lives of others one project at a time.” She then adds, “What distinguishes NJSFWC from other volunteer organizations is that we do not have a single focus.  Our member clubs across New Jersey select projects that are relevant to their members and address the needs of their communities. At the same time, NJSFWC offers clubs structure and support in their pursuit of community service. Clubs have the opportunity to join together with other federated clubs to make their impact on a project even more significant.” And, the tradition continues. Wolfe adds, “One way clubs work together is in support of the State Project, which is currently CASA, Court Appointed Special Advocates of New Jersey. Our clubs are working to raise public awareness of the organization and provide monetary  and in-kind donations. Just one example – this month clubs have been collecting craft items, such as coloring books and crayons, which will give the children in foster care an activity to do while their CASA volunteer and other adults are in discussions. Since the beginning of NJSFWC, clubs have worked tirelessly in support of legislation that is of significant importance to our Mission. Just recently, club members were asked to contact their legislator on the same day (Monday, September 23) to urge support for Miranda’s Law. (Miranda Vargas School Bus Driver Red Flag Act). This was done in conjunction with our international organization, General Federation of Women’s Clubs, which is headquartered in Washington, DC.  President of GFWC Mary Ellen Brock is from New Jersey and is a member of the North Jersey Woman’s Club.”Securing new members, as well as getting the word out to the communities served, is a challenge. Barbara McCloskey belongs to the Woman’s Club of the Denville-Rockaway area and is also Third Vice President and State Membership Chairman. “The passion of the women involved, the passion and dedication that the women have, I just feel that that passion should be better known to the communities and to the people out there. I don’t think people realize what these clubs are accomplishing or how much they’re doing.” Wolfe also claims that communication with members state-wide is sometimes challenging as well. “I think we’re making strides with that through our website (njsfwc.org).  Whereas previously all information was sent to club presidents, now all members have access to our state newsletters, projects ideas, etc.”Birthday #125 is being celebrated as only the NJSFWC knows how: by serving others. “Early in this administration,” says Wolfe, “the Shining Future Endowment Campaign was started to enable NJSFWC to continue our work well into the future.  Since the beginning of NJSFWC, most of our successes have been self-funded. But now we are looking to outside organizations for donations. Our dedicated website (www.njsfwcshiningfuture.org) was established to educate potential donors and provide a means to donate.  With the funds, we hope to increase scholarships, work with organizations dedicated to helping survivors of sexual abuse and human trafficking, conduct a Membership Awareness Campaign and invest funds to ensure the Federation will continue its important work for the next 125 years.” In addition, on November 16, the date of this amazing federation’s founding, the NJSFWC will hold a Day of Service.  Clubs will be collecting and donating items for college students. “These items will be donated to Embrella (formerly Foster and Adoptive Family Services) for distribution to college students who have aged-out of the Foster Care System and do not have family support that is so vital to young people starting college,” says Wolfe. New members are welcome.  To learn more about what the New Jersey State Federation of Women’s Clubs and what is offered, visit www.njsfwc.org for more information. The New Jersey Federation of Women’s Clubs Celebrates Its 125th Anniversary added by new_view_media on November 4, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "I have the honor and pleasure of knowing Pamela Reynolds Ross, since the first grade. For the most part, we were in each other’s classes all through grade school. We were very good friends. We stayed friends all through high school, but in attending a regional high school, sadly we lost a bit of the close friendship that we shared in grade school. Truly, Pamela is one of the kindest individuals whom I have ever known in my entire life.Pamela has been working very hard, for several decades, to find her biological daughter, whom Pamela gave up for adoption when she was only 17 years old. This was back in 1971. It was a different time then, a different culture. Nobly, Pamela signed adoption papers, thinking that would be best for her baby daughter.As the ink hit the paper, on the adoption papers, Pamela was truly alone. She was offered no legal counsel at all. She was offered no psychological counseling at all. The powers that be assured Pamela that she was doing the right thing. That giving up her baby daughter was for the best for her little daughter.In a room, the size of a closet, Pamela signed the adoption papers. Then, in a matter of seconds, her precious baby was whisked away from her, never to be seen by Pamela ever again.The biological father of Pamela’s beloved baby girl was a 24 year old Vietnam Veteran, whom Pamela had fallen deeply in love with. Dreams of marriage, a cottage, a white picket fence, were shattered, when the love of Pamela’s life, left her and shirked his responsibilities to help Pamela raise her beloved baby girl. Sadly, Pamela’s boyfriend at the time, suffered from a serious case of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Fast forward to the present time. Pamela simply wants her biological daughter to have the option to have the opportunity to meet her, if she wants. Pamela’s daughter is now 48 years old and would be capable of making that decision on her own. In Pamela’s own words, here is her perspective in a nutshell. “The whole point is this:  I’m not trying to replace the adoption family or win custody.  I never wanted to put my daughter through a tug-a-war. I simply would love to know she is well.  Importantly, she should have her vital health history.  I’ve asked if someone would kindly contact \n",
      "her and let her know our contact information.  At the age of 48, she can choose what she wants to do with that information.”So without further ado, here are the essential clues to the identity of Pamela’s biological daughter, whom Pamela relinquished for adoption back in 1971:Pamela gave birth to her baby girl on January 18th of 1971, at Chilton Hospital in Pompton Plains, New Jersey. The adoptive father was an accountant. The adoptive mother was a registered nurse. The couple had a six year old son, at the time they adopted Pamela’s baby girl. Sadly, Pamela has not been able to find a court or agency that will attempt to contact the woman who Pamela gave birth to and relinquished for adoption. The adoption process took place on November 16th of 1971 at the Morris County Courthouse in Morristown, New Jersey. The Adoption Agency, Department of Children and Families, was also located in Morristown. The adoptive couple were both of the Roman Catholic faith.  From all indications, it appears that this couple lived in Morris County in 1971. Sadly, these are the only clues that Pamela has, in her search to locate her biological daughter. Pamela is now 66 years old. Her biological daughter, whom she gave up for adoption, is now 48 years old. Pamela is more determined than ever to find her daughter. Pamela is emotionally prepared, if her biological daughter does not want to talk to her or see her. But for Pamela, she just longs to know if her daughter is healthy, safe and sound. If any of these clues ring a bell for you, please do contact Pamela. Her email address is: paross@visuallink.com. Regardless of how far reaching it may seem, if you know anyone for whom these few clues fit, please do contact Pamela. It would mean so very much to Pamela.  TO FIND HER DAUGHTER, PAMELA’S DETERMINED SEARCH added by new_view_media on November 4, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "By: Michele DiPasquale This year, Thanksgiving Day is November 28, and for many, it is a time to gather with our friends and family to give thanks for all that is good in our lives.Regrettably, there are those without family or friends with whom to celebrate this uniquely American holiday of gratitude, so for the fourth year in a row, Mary Lalama and her husband, Township Council President Joe Nicastro, both publishers and owners of New View Media Group – a network of local newspapers mailed to over 130,000 homes and businesses in Morris County – are hosting their Thanksgiving for all at the Mt. Olive Senior Center from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m.The feast will be a full Thanksgiving seated dinner, beginning with appetizers and antipasti, salad and pasta, continuing on to turkey, stuffing, mashed and sweet potatoes, assorted vegetables, and finishing with an assortment of pies for dessert. Goody bags of the day’s menu are also given to everyone to take home to enjoy as leftovers.Branda’s Italian Grill in Budd Lake, LongHorn Steakhouse in Flanders, Philly Pretzel Factory in Hackettstown, and corporate caterer Victoria Scherrer Onder are among the generous donators of the Thanksgiving banquet. Last year, table centerpieces were created by local Girls Scouts.When asked what prompted Lalama and Nicastro to open their hearts and offer Thanksgiving dinner to anyone who may have nowhere to go for the day, Lalama answered directly from her heart.“My family and I were sitting around on Thanksgiving four years ago and I said ‘Look at all this food we have. We are truly blessed and fortunate, and we need to think of a way to give back.’ So I said next year we’re going to host a traditional Thanksgiving dinner for anyone who is less fortunate or anyone who will be spending the day alone.”Forging ahead further and embracing what Thanksgiving truly is all about, Lalama and Nicastro even provide transportation for those who otherwise may not be able to join them for dinner. About 50 people have joined them so far, while some folks get their dinner delivered to their homes, as they may be unable to physically leave them.“The dinner is for anyone – single or a family – who may be less fortunate or who just are alone for the holiday. We hate to see people spend the holidays without family or friends, so we offer them a place to come and enjoy the company of others,” Lalama said.And though a buffet-style dinner would be easier, Lalama insists on a fully-seated dinner, in which her children and other volunteers serve everything.“We want everyone to feel like they are at a restaurant for the holiday,” she said.“I love the fact that we can help people come together and provide them with good food, good conversation, and good company. We get a lot of elderly people that just want someone to be with and know that someone cares about them. I love the look on their faces when they interact with each other and the volunteers,” Lalama said.Lalama said people are welcome to attend without reservations but are asked to sign up in advance by calling her at (973) 768-1815 or emailing her at mary.lalama@gmail.com.Mt.

      "The Many Colors of Love: Engagement Rings Get a Makeover\n",
      "WeddingDollarsCYou can thank Kim Kardashian and Kanye West for setting the bar so high when it comes to getting married.The average cost of a wedding — sans a honeymoon — has now soared to more than $31,000, according to the wedding planning website TheKnot. And experts say the “images of celebrity wedding extravagance,” a la last year’s $12 million “Kimye” nuptials in Florence, Italy, are influencing couples’ spending choices.Another reason for the jump, experts say, are the engagement rings.“People want big rings like the ones celebrities wear,” says Jason Kordvani, president of product development at Davani (davanijewelry.com), a family-owned company specializing in colored gemstones that has an almost 50-year reputation for creating some of the most gorgeous engagement rings around.Obviously, you don’t have to shell out that much to have the wedding of your dreams. But with this being the prime time for popping the question — 39 percent of all marriage proposals occur between Thanksgiving and Valentine’s Day — there is one trend that’s become both a must and a potential money-saving opportunity.Personalization, experts say, is on the rise.Here’s what we mean:• The engagement ring. If you’ve been reading the glossies, you know that celebs like Elizabeth Hurley and Jessica Simpson are breaking from tradition and wearing engagement rings with colored gemstones. Not only does this take fashion to a whole new level, but colored gemstones have also become a way to customize an engagement ring. And while it needn’t be her birthstone — Simpson’s is ruby, but Hurley’s sapphire jibes with the month her then-fiance was born — the right romantic touch can make for the ultimate in personalization.“It can also be the month a couple met or her favorite color,” says Kordvani.Whether sapphire, emerald, ruby or some other stone, Kordvani notes, couples are also often pleasantly surprised to discover they can get a “larger, more important-looking ring at much less cost than a diamond.” Davani Jewelry itself offers styles ranging from the more affordable Davani Bridal to the show-stopping Luxury Collection.• The reception. The bad news here is that spending on cocktail hours jumped 7 percent. So think signature cocktails rather than an open bar.• The wedding venue. “When couples get married, they’re really looking for interesting, unusual details,” Lorin Holmes, co-founder of VermontWeddings.com told USA Today. All things considered, the $50,000 price tag to hold a reception at the New York Public Library— anything cultural or historic is also hot — makes the average venue booking fee of $14,000 a little less jaw dropping.For more information, visit www.davanijewelry.com.The Many Colors of Love: Engagement Rings Get a Makeover added by new_view_media on December 22, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Many in the Morristown community and beyond knew Myles Mislavsky (Morristown High School – Class of 2013). His smile was contagious and his friendliness was well-known. To honor his life, his family – Hector Mislavsky, Judy Martinez and Jessie Mislavsky – has created a college-debt forgiveness fund – the Myles Smiled on You Award – for Morristown High School alumni to be administered by the Morris Educational Foundation. The award, for secondary education loan reduction, will be given to deserving MHS alumni who exemplify Myles’ many positive characteristics. It was created to reduce the burden of debt many students carry after college making it hard for them to save and get ahead. The award is funded by family, friends and the Golden Bagel Runners who knew and loved Myles. Myles was an amazing human being. Witty, charismatic, giving and loyal…these words merely scratch the surface in describing Myles. He made a lasting impact on the lives of those around him and was committed to helping others. He radiated joy with a smile so infectious that even on your worst days, he lifted your spirit. People were drawn to Myles and were better having known him. The award application is open to all Morristown High School alumni – Class of 2009 and after – who have graduated from a college, university or trade school (2 or 4 year) and have student loans. In 2019, this scholarship will be awarded to multiple alumni who graduated after 2009, at least one of whom graduated with Myles in 2013. In addition to demonstrating college debt burden, the award application requires 3 – 250 word or less essays: how have you dealt with challenging situations (mental or physical health, or other) and how did you or are you dealing with those challenges; describe how you have demonstrated empathy toward others; and what do you do to help your family/community, as well as a letter of recommendation. “We are honored to administer the Myles Smiled On You Award on behalf of the Mislavsky/Martinez family. We are so grateful to our donors, like the Mislavskys/Martinez Family, whose generosity inspires and impacts our Morristown High School community,” said Patty Haralampoudis, the Chair of the Morris Educational Foundation. It is the hope of the Mislavsky/Martinez Family that with this financial award, Myles will “smile on” Morristown High School alumni just as he did during his amazing life. Morris Educational Foundation Announces Myles Smiled on You Award for College-Debt Forgiveness Created in honor of Myles Mislavsky  added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "By Dawn M Chiossi  Morristown High School Graduate Amelia Langan has certainly been busy. Thanks to her recent activities in raising awareness about organ and tissue donation, she founded a Donate Life club at her school and was one of six students awarded a scholarship for the 2019-2020 academic year from the New Jersey Sharing Network.   The New Jersey Sharing Network is committed to saving and enhancing lives through organ donation. Giving a second chance at life, organ and tissue donation does just that. Just making that one decision can save lives, and make a huge, enriching impact on the lives of others.   As Langan discovered, it can also do the same thing for the self.   Like most people, Langan became aware of the importance of organ donation only when she took her driver’s education class in school. In hearing speaker– and liver transplant recipient–Michele Dabal, she became aware of how organ donation can impact and benefit others.  “She cleared up a lot of misconceptions and concerns that people have regarding organ donation,” Langan explains. “Hearing her story on how organ donation helped her to survive really resonated with me,” Langan shares.  Langan was so inspired by Dabal, she began to do her own research regarding organ donation, about how many lives could be changed for the better. It soon became a cause she became passionate about.   “One person can save up to eight lives with organ donation, and up to fifty with tissue donation,” she enthuses.  Langan was awarded the scholarship for diligently volunteering with the New Jersey Sharing Network, devoting an impressive 80 hours to volunteering.  Additionally, she raised awareness regarding organ and tissue donation for her Girl Scout Gold Award project.    Wanting to inspire others regarding organ donation, Langan founded a Donate Life club at her high school. The club came into existence during her junior year of 2017.    Describing Morristown’s Donate Life club as a small one of approximately 20-25 members, they do so much. Members volunteer with the New Jersey Sharing Network. Additionally, the club lined up speakers for people to hear inspiring stories regarding their organ and tissue donations.  For Langan, the goal was to get people talking about organ donation and to start a conversation about it. The club did this in a variety of ways.   “This is such an easy way to make a positive impact in our country. Organ donation affects everyone everywhere (even globally). It is so widespread,” she asserts. Through her passion and research, Langan and the club discovered that in Morristown alone, approximately 21 people were on the list looking for a transplant. “Everyone knows someone affected.”  Although Langan is a Freshman at Boston’s Northeastern University and is already fully committed to majoring in behavioral neuroscience and minoring in biochemistry to go into the field of research for cancer, she still is helping in the cause close to her heart. She has extended the parameters of the club, creating a video explaining and inspiring other high school students how they can help in the cause of organ donation and create a Donate Life club of their own.  Langan’s excitement to inspire others to make a difference through organ and tissue donation has even extended to her sister and her sister’s best friend. Both are going to take up the mantle of Morristown’s Donate Life club, to put their own ideas to it.   For Langan, everything is connected and stems from the information and inspiration she received from Driver’s Ed class. “I was so surprised to receive the scholarship,” she shares. “I didn’t think I had a chance of winning. It was Michele who persuaded me to apply. If I hadn’t met her, I wouldn’t have been inspired to do any of this.

      "By: Jason Cohen Swimming runs in the blood of Jack Alexy. All of his siblings are swimmers, but he will be the first to have the chance to be in the Olympics. In June 2020, the Mendham resident will be competing against 1500 people in the Olympic Trials for swimming in Omaha, Neb. “I’m not going to know how it feels until I’m there,” Alexy said. “I know I’m definitely going to be nervous.” Alexy, 16, is a junior at Delbarton School in Morristown and has been swimming for the Somerset Hills YMCA Swim team in Basking Ridge since he was 8. After watching his older siblings Kate, 20, and Max, 18, swim; he quickly fell in love with the sport and followed in their footsteps. While his parents Lynn and Matt were not swimmers, they felt it was important for their children to learn. Their younger brother, Rob, 15, also swims.“My parents just wanted all of their kids to know how to swim for safety,” Alexy explained. Alexy said Kate and Max had a big influence on him. Swimming brought them closer and they taught him to never give up and always stay calm. In fact, Kate swims at Kenyon College in Ohio and Alexy hopes to swim in college as well. Alexy also played basketball, but quit in eighth grade to focus on swimming.He started to realize he had a future in swimming three years ago when he made the YMCA Nationals team. After that, he made nationals the next three years.Today swimming is a huge part of his life. He practices six days a week for two hours a day and has a few dry practices as well. In fact, he met some of his best friends from swimming.“That’s one of the best things about swimming, the people and the bonds,” he commented. In 2016 Lori Riegler took over as his coach. Over the past few years they have gotten close and she has helped him become a better swimmer. Alexy knows he has a long road ahead as he prepares for the Olympic Trials. He qualified for the 50 and 100 meter freestyle and in order to make the Olympics has to finish top two in an event. Right now he trains by swimming 25 yards, but in the trials it is 50 meters. So, in February, he will change his to 50. “It’s pretty crazy,” he said. “I still got a lot of work to do before then.”In August, he had a bit of a preview of what it will be like at the trials when he participated in the World Junior Championships in Budapest, Hungary. It was his first intentional competition. “It’s (Olympic Trials) definitely special,’ he said. “I got a little taste of that over the summer in Budapest.” Mendham Resident to Compete in Olympic Trials for Swimming  added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "By: Elise Phillips Margulis  Mendham-based artist Jeff Gould, known for his stunning fine art landscapes and abstract Surrealistic compositions, is having an  exhibition called “Views from Schiff” which will feature paintings directly from and inspired by Schiff Nature Preserve in Mendham.  Gould will be showing his “nature and animal surreal mashups” as well. The exhibit will also include Japanese-inspired artwork by artist Al Gunther www.dragonflystudios-algunther.com.” The “Views from Schiff” exhibit will be on October 5th from 4:00 to 6:00 p.m. at the Alhamra Gallery and Art Center in Bernardsville. Blues legend Barry Blues will play a music set and refreshments will be served. The entertainment and food are free. Some of the proceeds will go to Schiff Nature Preserve. Gould hails from New Rochelle, NY. He recalls being “artistic at a very early age and copying cartoons out of the newspaper, including Charlie Brown for a piece of promotional material for my kindergarten class.” He drew “Mad Magazine” characters when he was a bit older. Gould also enjoyed drawing superheroes. Some of his favorite artists and inspirations are Mort Drucker and Don Martin. Gould’s biggest childhood artist influence was Norman Rockwell. “I used to sit down for hours with pencil and paper trying to copy his paintings,” shared Gould.  “Oddly, we seem to occupy the same towns. From growing up in New Rochelle where he lived, to spending summers in the Berkshires where his main studio was.” Gould added, “And now I live in the Schiff on Rockwell Court which was named after him because he had a studio here and painted some of the early covers of the Boy Scout manuals!” After Gould graduated from University of the Arts in Philadelphia, he designed toys for a company in New York. Then he designed packaging for the pharmaceutical industry. His next position was Art Director and then Marketing Director in the Midwest. Gould’s wife, Karen, is from northwest Indiana on the Chicago side. After they were married they lived in different areas of the United States and in Canada. When Karen accepted a job at AT&T in 2001, they “fell in love with this area.”  Gould decided to become a stay-at-home dad and work as a freelancer doing illustration, graphic design and portraits when his children were born.  “I always loved the masters like Da Vinci and Rubens. Rockwell and Maxfield Parish were also some of my favorites. I also loved the French impressionists and nature and started doing oils, mainly for fun.” He was able to achieve his dream of having his work hang in homes and galleries as his children got older. Once they were more self-sufficient he immersed himself into painting his own masterpieces. Living in the Brookrace subdivision of Schiff enables him to explore the gorgeous nature preserve daily. “I walk my dog on the many trails every day of the year. I am never at a loss for the beauty that nature provides.”  In addition to enjoying Schiff, Gould noted, “My wife and I love hiking and scuba diving and nature in general. And trying to communicate that beauty with a paintbrush is my passion.” Gould won the Award of Excellence from The Center for Contemporary Art in Bernardsville for his “Schiff Meadow #2” painting over the summer.  Gould invites you to attend his October 5th Gallery Exhibit to enjoy his vibrant surrealistic painting, blues music and delicious food. A portion of the proceeds will be donated to the Schiff. The Alhamra Gallery & Art Center is located at 21 Clairmont Rd, Bernardsville. Mendham Artist Will Exhibit Paintings at Alhamra Gallery & Art Center in Bernardsville on October 5 added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "By Dawn M Chiossi  Going on since February of this year, Hackettstown’s Heath Village inspires their staff with its English Language Program.   This program is a class format, an offshoot of the Adult English Language Tutoring Program sponsored by the Literacy New Jersey Sussex Branch. This program is for any adult in Sussex or Warren Counties, who would like to improve their facility with English– making them more comfortable speaking English.    It has been said that education is a great equalizer. It opens doors to everyone; it stirs curiosity, accesses information, and lets the mind ponder, inquire and enjoy.   The English Language Program is spearheaded and run by two-year Heath Village resident, Marguerite Gadel, as well as Susan Sumner. Gadel explains that the program works with the State and Local Literacy New Jersey Organization’s Sussex Branch (a branch that expands to Warren County.)  Gadel herself had been a part of the literacy organization for an impressive 20 years.   Although relatively new, Heath Village’s program is an informal, inclusive one. It focuses mainly on spoken communication, conversational English, and some grammar and spelling.  Concentrating on how to be comfortable speaking English, students will learn enough to communicate easily in functional areas such as making appointments or filling out forms. The program seeks to make communications easier and much more fluid, both in work and social situations.   Additionally, the class will make it more enjoyable for students to follow a TV program or read a book. “I want them to really enjoy reading in English,” Gadel shares.   “There’s even some students in the class who are taking their test for citizenship. That’s a big job,” she prides.  Gadel explains that she came up with the idea of starting the program soon after she moved to Heath Village.   Immediately proposing the idea to Heath Village’s CEO to make the program available, and receiving an overwhelmingly positive response, she set to work.   Wanting the English Language Program to be engaging and relatable for the students, the program involves them right away by having them read out loud. “We try to jump on something of interest to the students or go over something from the week before that they had learned,” Gadel explains.    For these students, learning English is not a chore, but a pleasure.  Gadel can’t say enough about her students in general, admiring their determination and hard work ethic. “They come to class completely on their own time. Usually after working a full day. Then they’ll have to go home, take care of their families and do homework. It’s so impressive that they are willing to put in the time and effort to do this,” she enthuses.  They will even find creative ways to learn. For example, Gadel relates that one of her students will watch the news without subtitles to learn what is going on.  For Gadel, just the small act of using her talents to make a difference in the lives of others has created a ripple effect. “I love seeing the students help each other,” she says. “For instance, a student from Mexico will help someone from Colombia. It is wonderful to see that happen. It is thrilling to see them put in so much effort and work so hard to learn.”  Gadel sees with her own eyes how much of an impact the program is making to her students. They are not only learning but enjoying. What’s more, they are sharing that feeling and connection with others.  “I remember when the class discovered that Heath Village had a new resident, a lady from England who had been in England’s Royal Air Force (R.A.F.) in World War II,” Gadel shares. “A student had recently read an article to us regarding the R.A.F. Because of that, the class eagerly wanted to talk to this lady and ask her questions. They were so involved, asking about her experiences and how they were different in England as opposed to here in America. It was wonderful.”  The Literacy New Jersey Sussex Branch will be training new volunteers to be tutors beginning in late September.  Training for new tutors is offered in the spring and the fall. It is ideal for someone who would like to make a difference, no experience is necessary.  Training consists of three in-person meetings interspersed with online training. The first session is especially useful in helping people decide whether or not they would like to do the tutoring. “I would love to encourage some people to train for this great volunteer work. We always have waiting students,” Gadel enthuses. For further information or details on tutoring, please contact Literacy New Jersey Sussex County Office at 973-300-9444 or by visiting www.literacynj.orgHackettstown’s Heath Village Inspires Staff with English Language Program added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "How To Plan A Smooth Group Ski Trip(NAPSI)—According to a study from Wyndham Vacation Rentals, most travelers take ski and snowboard vacations in groups of four or more. Hitting the slopes with a big group doesn’t have to be hard, even when it comes to coordinating everyone’s schedules and travel arrangements.Group Ski Trip TipsWhile it can be challenging to keep everyone happy during the vacation, these planning hints can help get everyone started on the right foot.• Find the right lodging. When traveling with a larger group, alternative lodging options might be your best bet. A cabin, condo or home lets everyone stay together under one roof without sacrificing privacy. Everyone can have his or her own bedroom, while common spaces such as a living room or dining room make spending time together easy. Most rental homes also feature a kitchen, which can cut down on the stress of dining out as a large group. Have everyone take a night to prepare dinner. You’ll not only save money, you’ll enjoy time together without the interruptions of a busy restaurant.• Plan for transportation. When researching lodging, see if your accommodations rest along a community shuttle route or offer their own shuttle services. Also look into the destination’s transit systems. Sun Valley, for example, offers free bus service. If you’re renting a car, make sure you plan for times when the group splits up. Leaving half the group stranded won’t make for a fun situation.• Agree on activities beforehand. While skiing and snowboarding may be the top priorities, there are plenty of other activities to do during a ski trip. From dogsledding and snow tubing to unique local festivals, you might find attractions you just don’t want to miss. Have everyone weigh in on top choices before the trip, especially those who are attending but who aren’t avid skiers or snowboarders. Considering everyone’s preferences in advance can help reduce stress during the trip itself.• Give everyone some downtime. Opinions often differ, especially within larger groups, so allow for flexibility during the trip. If your muscles are begging for a break, read a book or squeeze in a post-run nap while your fellow travelers stay on the slopes. If half of the group wants to head downtown for the afternoon while the other half wants to get in another mountain activity, split up for a few hours. By staying flexible with the group’s itinerary, you’ll avoid any tension and better enjoy the time you all spend together.Learn MoreTo start your planning now, you can visit www.WyndhamVacationRentals.com for deals on vacation rental homes in some of North America’s top ski destinations.How To Plan A Smooth Group Ski Trip added by new_view_media on December 22, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Many in the Morristown community and beyond knew Myles Mislavsky (Morristown High School – Class of 2013). His smile was contagious and his friendliness was well-known. To honor his life, his family – Hector Mislavsky, Judy Martinez and Jessie Mislavsky – has created a college-debt forgiveness fund – the Myles Smiled on You Award – for Morristown High School alumni to be administered by the Morris Educational Foundation. The award, for secondary education loan reduction, will be given to deserving MHS alumni who exemplify Myles’ many positive characteristics. It was created to reduce the burden of debt many students carry after college making it hard for them to save and get ahead. The award is funded by family, friends and the Golden Bagel Runners who knew and loved Myles. Myles was an amazing human being. Witty, charismatic, giving and loyal…these words merely scratch the surface in describing Myles. He made a lasting impact on the lives of those around him and was committed to helping others. He radiated joy with a smile so infectious that even on your worst days, he lifted your spirit. People were drawn to Myles and were better having known him. The award application is open to all Morristown High School alumni – Class of 2009 and after – who have graduated from a college, university or trade school (2 or 4 year) and have student loans. In 2019, this scholarship will be awarded to multiple alumni who graduated after 2009, at least one of whom graduated with Myles in 2013. In addition to demonstrating college debt burden, the award application requires 3 – 250 word or less essays: how have you dealt with challenging situations (mental or physical health, or other) and how did you or are you dealing with those challenges; describe how you have demonstrated empathy toward others; and what do you do to help your family/community, as well as a letter of recommendation. “We are honored to administer the Myles Smiled On You Award on behalf of the Mislavsky/Martinez family. We are so grateful to our donors, like the Mislavskys/Martinez Family, whose generosity inspires and impacts our Morristown High School community,” said Patty Haralampoudis, the Chair of the Morris Educational Foundation. It is the hope of the Mislavsky/Martinez Family that with this financial award, Myles will “smile on” Morristown High School alumni just as he did during his amazing life. Morris Educational Foundation Announces Myles Smiled on You Award for College-Debt Forgiveness Created in honor of Myles Mislavsky  added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "By Dawn M Chiossi  Morristown High School Graduate Amelia Langan has certainly been busy. Thanks to her recent activities in raising awareness about organ and tissue donation, she founded a Donate Life club at her school and was one of six students awarded a scholarship for the 2019-2020 academic year from the New Jersey Sharing Network.   The New Jersey Sharing Network is committed to saving and enhancing lives through organ donation. Giving a second chance at life, organ and tissue donation does just that. Just making that one decision can save lives, and make a huge, enriching impact on the lives of others.   As Langan discovered, it can also do the same thing for the self.   Like most people, Langan became aware of the importance of organ donation only when she took her driver’s education class in school. In hearing speaker– and liver transplant recipient–Michele Dabal, she became aware of how organ donation can impact and benefit others.  “She cleared up a lot of misconceptions and concerns that people have regarding organ donation,” Langan explains. “Hearing her story on how organ donation helped her to survive really resonated with me,” Langan shares.  Langan was so inspired by Dabal, she began to do her own research regarding organ donation, about how many lives could be changed for the better. It soon became a cause she became passionate about.   “One person can save up to eight lives with organ donation, and up to fifty with tissue donation,” she enthuses.  Langan was awarded the scholarship for diligently volunteering with the New Jersey Sharing Network, devoting an impressive 80 hours to volunteering.  Additionally, she raised awareness regarding organ and tissue donation for her Girl Scout Gold Award project.    Wanting to inspire others regarding organ donation, Langan founded a Donate Life club at her high school. The club came into existence during her junior year of 2017.    Describing Morristown’s Donate Life club as a small one of approximately 20-25 members, they do so much. Members volunteer with the New Jersey Sharing Network. Additionally, the club lined up speakers for people to hear inspiring stories regarding their organ and tissue donations.  For Langan, the goal was to get people talking about organ donation and to start a conversation about it. The club did this in a variety of ways.   “This is such an easy way to make a positive impact in our country. Organ donation affects everyone everywhere (even globally). It is so widespread,” she asserts. Through her passion and research, Langan and the club discovered that in Morristown alone, approximately 21 people were on the list looking for a transplant. “Everyone knows someone affected.”  Although Langan is a Freshman at Boston’s Northeastern University and is already fully committed to majoring in behavioral neuroscience and minoring in biochemistry to go into the field of research for cancer, she still is helping in the cause close to her heart. She has extended the parameters of the club, creating a video explaining and inspiring other high school students how they can help in the cause of organ donation and create a Donate Life club of their own.  Langan’s excitement to inspire others to make a difference through organ and tissue donation has even extended to her sister and her sister’s best friend. Both are going to take up the mantle of Morristown’s Donate Life club, to put their own ideas to it.   For Langan, everything is connected and stems from the information and inspiration she received from Driver’s Ed class. “I was so surprised to receive the scholarship,” she shares. “I didn’t think I had a chance of winning. It was Michele who persuaded me to apply. If I hadn’t met her, I wouldn’t have been inspired to do any of this. It wasn’t just me, (being awarded the scholarship or success of the club) so many people were a beacon of encouragement. From Michele, to Brooke, and Daniel Sarnowski at New Jersey Sharing Network, to so many others behind the scenes. I’m very grateful.”Changing the World, Raising Awareness About Organ and Tissue Donation, Morristown Grad Founds Donate Life Club, Wins Scholarship added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "By: Jason Cohen Swimming runs in the blood of Jack Alexy. All of his siblings are swimmers, but he will be the first to have the chance to be in the Olympics. In June 2020, the Mendham resident will be competing against 1500 people in the Olympic Trials for swimming in Omaha, Neb. “I’m not going to know how it feels until I’m there,” Alexy said. “I know I’m definitely going to be nervous.” Alexy, 16, is a junior at Delbarton School in Morristown and has been swimming for the Somerset Hills YMCA Swim team in Basking Ridge since he was 8. After watching his older siblings Kate, 20, and Max, 18, swim; he quickly fell in love with the sport and followed in their footsteps. While his parents Lynn and Matt were not swimmers, they felt it was important for their children to learn. Their younger brother, Rob, 15, also swims.“My parents just wanted all of their kids to know how to swim for safety,” Alexy explained. Alexy said Kate and Max had a big influence on him. Swimming brought them closer and they taught him to never give up and always stay calm. In fact, Kate swims at Kenyon College in Ohio and Alexy hopes to swim in college as well. Alexy also played basketball, but quit in eighth grade to focus on swimming.He started to realize he had a future in swimming three years ago when he made the YMCA Nationals team. After that, he made nationals the next three years.Today swimming is a huge part of his life. He practices six days a week for two hours a day and has a few dry practices as well. In fact, he met some of his best friends from swimming.“That’s one of the best things about swimming, the people and the bonds,” he commented. In 2016 Lori Riegler took over as his coach. Over the past few years they have gotten close and she has helped him become a better swimmer. Alexy knows he has a long road ahead as he prepares for the Olympic Trials. He qualified for the 50 and 100 meter freestyle and in order to make the Olympics has to finish top two in an event. Right now he trains by swimming 25 yards, but in the trials it is 50 meters. So, in February, he will change his to 50. “It’s pretty crazy,” he said. “I still got a lot of work to do before then.”In August, he had a bit of a preview of what it will be like at the trials when he participated in the World Junior Championships in Budapest, Hungary. It was his first intentional competition. “It’s (Olympic Trials) definitely special,’ he said. “I got a little taste of that over the summer in Budapest.” Mendham Resident to Compete in Olympic Trials for Swimming  added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "By: Elise Phillips Margulis  Mendham-based artist Jeff Gould, known for his stunning fine art landscapes and abstract Surrealistic compositions, is having an  exhibition called “Views from Schiff” which will feature paintings directly from and inspired by Schiff Nature Preserve in Mendham.  Gould will be showing his “nature and animal surreal mashups” as well. The exhibit will also include Japanese-inspired artwork by artist Al Gunther www.dragonflystudios-algunther.com.” The “Views from Schiff” exhibit will be on October 5th from 4:00 to 6:00 p.m. at the Alhamra Gallery and Art Center in Bernardsville. Blues legend Barry Blues will play a music set and refreshments will be served. The entertainment and food are free. Some of the proceeds will go to Schiff Nature Preserve. Gould hails from New Rochelle, NY. He recalls being “artistic at a very early age and copying cartoons out of the newspaper, including Charlie Brown for a piece of promotional material for my kindergarten class.” He drew “Mad Magazine” characters when he was a bit older. Gould also enjoyed drawing superheroes. Some of his favorite artists and inspirations are Mort Drucker and Don Martin. Gould’s biggest childhood artist influence was Norman Rockwell. “I used to sit down for hours with pencil and paper trying to copy his paintings,” shared Gould.  “Oddly, we seem to occupy the same towns. From growing up in New Rochelle where he lived, to spending summers in the Berkshires where his main studio was.” Gould added, “And now I live in the Schiff on Rockwell Court which was named after him because he had a studio here and painted some of the early covers of the Boy Scout manuals!” After Gould graduated from University of the Arts in Philadelphia, he designed toys for a company in New York. Then he designed packaging for the pharmaceutical industry. His next position was Art Director and then Marketing Director in the Midwest. Gould’s wife, Karen, is from northwest Indiana on the Chicago side. After they were married they lived in different areas of the United States and in Canada. When Karen accepted a job at AT&T in 2001, they “fell in love with this area.”  Gould decided to become a stay-at-home dad and work as a freelancer doing illustration, graphic design and portraits when his children were born.  “I always loved the masters like Da Vinci and Rubens. Rockwell and Maxfield Parish were also some of my favorites. I also loved the French impressionists and nature and started doing oils, mainly for fun.” He was able to achieve his dream of having his work hang in homes and galleries as his children got older. Once they were more self-sufficient he immersed himself into painting his own masterpieces. Living in the Brookrace subdivision of Schiff enables him to explore the gorgeous nature preserve daily. “I walk my dog on the many trails every day of the year. I am never at a loss for the beauty that nature provides.”  In addition to enjoying Schiff, Gould noted, “My wife and I love hiking and scuba diving and nature in general. And trying to communicate that beauty with a paintbrush is my passion.” Gould won the Award of Excellence from The Center for Contemporary Art in Bernardsville for his “Schiff Meadow #2” painting over the summer.  Gould invites you to attend his October 5th Gallery Exhibit to enjoy his vibrant surrealistic painting, blues music and delicious food. A portion of the proceeds will be donated to the Schiff. The Alhamra Gallery & Art Center is located at 21 Clairmont Rd, Bernardsville. Mendham Artist Will Exhibit Paintings at Alhamra Gallery & Art Center in Bernardsville on October 5 added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "By Dawn M Chiossi  Going on since February of this year, Hackettstown’s Heath Village inspires their staff with its English Language Program.   This program is a class format, an offshoot of the Adult English Language Tutoring Program sponsored by the Literacy New Jersey Sussex Branch. This program is for any adult in Sussex or Warren Counties, who would like to improve their facility with English– making them more comfortable speaking English.    It has been said that education is a great equalizer. It opens doors to everyone; it stirs curiosity, accesses information, and lets the mind ponder, inquire and enjoy.   The English Language Program is spearheaded and run by two-year Heath Village resident, Marguerite Gadel, as well as Susan Sumner. Gadel explains that the program works with the State and Local Literacy New Jersey Organization’s Sussex Branch (a branch that expands to Warren County.)  Gadel herself had been a part of the literacy organization for an impressive 20 years.   Although relatively new, Heath Village’s program is an informal, inclusive one. It focuses mainly on spoken communication, conversational English, and some grammar and spelling.  Concentrating on how to be comfortable speaking English, students will learn enough to communicate easily in functional areas such as making appointments or filling out forms. The program seeks to make communications easier and much more fluid, both in work and social situations.   Additionally, the class will make it more enjoyable for students to follow a TV program or read a book. “I want them to really enjoy reading in English,” Gadel shares.   “There’s even some students in the class who are taking their test for citizenship. That’s a big job,” she prides.  Gadel explains that she came up with the idea of starting the program soon after she moved to Heath Village.   Immediately proposing the idea to Heath Village’s CEO to make the program available, and receiving an overwhelmingly positive response, she set to work.   Wanting the English Language Program to be engaging and relatable for the students, the program involves them right away by having them read out loud. “We try to jump on something of interest to the students or go over something from the week before that they had learned,” Gadel explains.    For these students, learning English is not a chore, but a pleasure.  Gadel can’t say enough about her students in general, admiring their determination and hard work ethic. “They come to class completely on their own time. Usually after working a full day. Then they’ll have to go home, take care of their families and do homework. It’s so impressive that they are willing to put in the time and effort to do this,” she enthuses.  They will even find creative ways to learn. For example, Gadel relates that one of her students will watch the news without subtitles to learn what is going on.  For Gadel, just the small act of using her talents to make a difference in the lives of others has created a ripple effect. “I love seeing the students help each other,” she says. “For instance, a student from Mexico will help someone from Colombia. It is wonderful to see that happen. It is thrilling to see them put in so much effort and work so hard to learn.”  Gadel sees with her own eyes how much of an impact the program is making to her students. They are not only learning but enjoying. What’s more, they are sharing that feeling and connection with others.  “I remember when the class discovered that Heath Village had a new resident, a lady from England who had been in England’s Royal Air Force (R.A.F.) in World War II,” Gadel shares. “A student had recently read an article to us regarding the R.A.F. Because of that, the class eagerly wanted to talk to this lady and ask her questions. They were so involved, asking about her experiences and how they were different in England as opposed to here in America. It was wonderful.”  The Literacy New Jersey Sussex Branch will be training new volunteers to be tutors beginning in late September.  Training for new tutors is offered in the spring and the fall. It is ideal for someone who would like to make a difference, no experience is necessary.  Training consists of three in-person meetings interspersed with online training. The first session is especially useful in helping people decide whether or not they would like to do the tutoring. “I would love to encourage some people to train for this great volunteer work. We always have waiting students,” Gadel enthuses. For further information or details on tutoring, please contact Literacy New Jersey Sussex County Office at 973-300-9444 or by visiting www.literacynj.orgHackettstown’s Heath Village Inspires Staff with English Language Program added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Unveiled earlier this year after several years of planning, the Center for Nursing Innovation and Research (CNIR) for Morristown Medical Center (MMC) is providing greater research and innovation.\n",
      "MMC holds the American Nurses Credentialing Center’s (ANCC) designation of a “magnet facility;” inspired by the ANCC requirement for its “magnet recognition program,” a formal plan to expand innovation and research resources via a specialized nursing center evolved. With support from the Women’s Association for MMC, the organizers were able to realize their vision this year.\n",
      "“We are grateful to the Women’s Association for MMC for the funding to support the CNIR,” said Carol Jones, chief nursing officer of MMC. “Within ten months of receiving funding the new space was built and utilized.”\n",
      "According to Jones, the primary goal of CNIR will be “improving patient and family outcomes related to the health and well-being of individuals.” This design will be accomplished by utilizing CNIR’s research capacity to find improvements in healthcare, researching best practices or by exploring innovative changes in care delivery. PhD-prepped nurses will be spearheading all research and innovative\n",
      "endeavors at the center.\n",
      "According to Jones, one benefit of the CNIR is more flexible scheduling. For example, two formal education programs for research and innovation are held annually at MMC; the classes now take place at the CNIR, facilitating participation.\n",
      "Additionally, the CNIR will hold classes highlighting new perspectives leading to innovations in the fall. An Evidence-based Scholar Program is also now held at the center.\n",
      "Jones pointed out the various ways that the CNIR will serve the diverse needs of nurses.\n",
      "“Frequently, there is a research component associated with academic studies,” said Jones. Nurses who are required to conduct research for academic purposes [can do so at CNIR], and seek guidance from nurse researchers at the center. Other nurses seek to learn about the evaluation of existing evidence or how to generate new\n",
      "knowledge through research.”\n",
      "The CNIR is open to any nurse working at Morristown Medical Center, and no special requirements are needed to meet with the nurse researchers about new ideas or research projects.\n",
      "“Motivated nurses are welcome and encouraged to utilize the resources and space!” Jones stated, adding that the formal classes on Evidence-based Practice and Innovation require an application due to limited class size.\n",
      "According to Jones, in the short period of time since the CNIR’s opening, nurses and physicians have provided favorable feedback. The frequent use of the space, including use by interprofessional teams for concept exploration and assistance planning studies has demonstrated the need for and desirability of the center.\n",
      "Additionally, members of the non-medical community who have seen the CNIR have shared their enthusiasm for nursing activities with Jones and her colleagues.\n",
      "Expressing hope that use of the center will continue to evolve and grow, Jones stated that nursing leadership at MMC will perhaps engage members of the community and area organizations, such as the Women’s Association for Morristown Medical Center, to collaborate on efforts of how to best serve the community.\n",
      "“Serving the community, as well as improving patient outcomes, are goals of the Atlantic Health System and Morristown Medical Center,” Jones said. “Nurse leaders at Morristown Medical Center have always been innovators!”New Medical Center Aims To Encourage Nursing Innovation added by new_view_media on August 22, 2018View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Congratulations! The college process is over! The applying, the application fees, the running around for recommendation letters. It’s all over. Now the whole family is probably running to the nearest Bed Bath and Beyond trying to find which comforter is the most “aesthetically pleasing” to the ideal dream college dorm. Before running for those necessities, come back to reality and realize that this isn’t the end of the worry.\n",
      "For most families, how much money college will cost is top priority because as years continue, the prices for schools climb. Have no fear, here are some ways for soon to be college students to save and make money to help them keep college costs as low as possible.\n",
      "Apply for federal work study Federal Work Study is a program most schools have in which students receive a job through the student employment office. The money that the student earns does not go toward their tuition but instead goes to the student as cash during the semester. Depending on the school, they allow students a certain amount of money to earn. Mary Primich of Trenton, a sophomore at\n",
      "Monmouth University double majoring in secondary education and English, works on campus at Pollak Theater through federal work study.\n",
      "“It’s hard getting a job when you’re in school,” she says. “It’s cool how we’re able to work on campus throughout the semester and get paid for it. I use a little bit of it for day to day expenses and then the other half I save some of it to pay off my loans.”\n",
      "Federal work study is also a great way for students to get involved with their school as well as making money.\n",
      "Apply for EOF\n",
      "EOF (Educational Opportunity Fund), is a scholarship that allows New Jersey students to receive a well-rounded education that they normally would not be able to afford. Given to those students more than capable of doing great things after college, chosen applicants are given full admission to the university that they attend, financial support, and services throughout the year to help them succeed during their next four years.\n",
      "Arina Martin of Jackson, a sophomore at Monmouth University majoring in music, is one EOF\n",
      "scholarship recipient. She states “EOF has given me the opportunity to go to college when I couldn’t afford it. Without it (EOF), I’m not sure if I would have been able to go to a university.”\n",
      "Be sure to check out the school’s website for their EOF program or call the school’s EOF department for requirements in seeking this financial help.\n",
      "Staying at home for school isn’t always bad\n",
      "Community college saves students money on food, room and board as well as other expenses such as room décor and transportation.\n",
      "Kassidy Orzechowski of Clifton, who recently transferred from Monmouth to go to Bergen Community College explains “I was supposed to go to Montclair but Montclair suggested I go to\n",
      "my local community college because getting your associates degree counts as having your general education requirements completed, so it makes more sense and it’s cheaper.”\n",
      "Although some may look down upon going to a community college, many would agree that these students are making a wise choice as the cost difference between a community college and a university is evident.Orzechowski explains, “I’m paying $2,500 to be a full-time student this semester instead of $16,000+ a semester. If I did this a year ago I’d be in a better position because no matter what all of my credits would have transferred so I’d be in a better position.”\n",
      "Sell old clothes to a local thrift store\n",
      "Selling items and clothing that the student no longer uses anymore is a perfect way to not only save and make money, but to help the student determine what items are important versus completely irrelevant. By selling clothes at stores such as Platos Closet in Ledgewood, a recycling store that allows customers to sell gently used clothes for cash and other items that they do not use, the student can save space in the car for move in day and make some extra cash.\n",
      "Bryanna Welch of Long Branch, a sophomore at Monmouth University majoring in sociology, endeavors in shopping at thrift stores.\n",
      "She states “If we are comparing goodwill to Urban Outfitters, then I would be saving so much money. Usually I compare quality and cleanliness of the clothing itself. I like good will because it\n",
      "helps out charities.”\n",
      "Summer jobs\n",

Carolyn Welch of Long Branch, a sophomore at Monmouth University, says “Summer jobs are the way to go for college kids. You get bored in the summer anyways, so why not make some money!” Welch advises to incoming freshmen to “Get a job for the summer before you go to college and save up money for the first semester for whatever it is they want to spend it on whether it be going out to eat or shopping. If you receive any money for Christmas, be sure to save it up for the next semester and file for tax returns in March!”\n",

      "“Today’s Care, Tomorrow’s cure:” This is the inspiring mission of the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation.\n",
      "On July 1, the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation in Short Hills received a three year, 6.5 million dollar federal grant to help people who are living with spinal cord injuries and other conditions that cause paralysis. Some of these conditions include spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, (ALS), stroke, spina bifida and cerebral palsy. This money will aid these people in\n",
      "the many battles and challenges they face on a daily basis, enhancing their lives.\n",
      "The foundation is the recipient of the National Paralysis Resource Center cooperative agreement from the Administration for Community Living.   The Reeve Foundation has operated the Paralysis Resource Center (PRC) for approximately 16 years.\n",
      "Quality of life: Everyone strives to obtain it, the enjoyment and independence that make life worth living. So many people take it for granted.  But having quality of life is often difficult, if not nearly impossible, when people have physical disabilities impeding their way.\n",
      "But those from the Short Hills based Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation seek to change that. Their belief is simple: That every human being should be able to obtain and lead full and rich lives, regardless of their physical condition. They have an unwavering conviction that every human being deserves a life filled with\n",
      "dignity.\n",
      "Both Christopher and Dana Reeve were staunch advocates and champions for the disabled. After his horse riding accident that left him paralyzed in 1995, actor Christopher Reeve put a human and familiar face on those who are enduring spinal cord injuries and paralysis.  No more could people pretend that it was just an\n",
      "anonymous person who was suffering with a disability: Reeve was famous, and had been considered synonymous with Superman!  But he was more than just a celebrity or a figurehead.  He and his wife Dana were activists, driven to create positive changes. Utterly passionate regarding helping these fellow courageous folks living with physical challenges, Reeve simply considered them heroes. He\n",
      "staunchly sought to give them hope, because he knew how easily they could feel hopeless.\n",
      "A staggering 1 in 50 people in the United States, approximately 5.4 million Americans live with paralysis of some kind. And those aren’t just numbers or statistics; they are people close to us. “We all know someone a brother, sister, friend, neighbor or colleague who is suffering with paralysis. They aren’t strangers. They are one degree of separation from all of us,” officials assert.\n",
      "The Reeves’ Foundation is dedicated to performing innovative research, securing grants, providing information and much needed advocacy to aid their clients.\n",
      "During the past 16 years and moving forward, The Reeve Foundation and National Paralysis Resource Center continue to compete in a rigorous bidding process for every three years’ worth of funding, but the results for their clients are golden.\n",
      "Since it opened in 2002, 100,000 people have been aided by this organization with approximately 20,000 people helped in the past three years alone.\n",
      "According to Anna Chamberlain, supervisor of Marketing and Communications for the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation since 2015, the Reeve Foundation has a dual mission.\n",
      "“We focus on creating resources and programs to help the 5.4 million Americans and their families impacted by paralysis though our Paralysis Resource Center while also funding innovative and cutting edge research to find cures for spinal cord injuries in the near future,” she explains.\n",
      "Offering a multitude of free services such as their peer program which offers a way of connecting individuals and caregivers with respective peer mentors to offer much needed emotional support, their military veterans program, information specialists, quality of life grants, program advocacy, and policy programs, these resources are designed to aid the whole individual.  They empower both the body and spirit, to help to navigate the insecure journey ahead.\n",
      "“The programs help individuals return to actively participating in their communities, achieving independence and self-sufficiency, achieving things we take for granted like learning how to drive again, going back to work and even leaving their own homes are also ways in which the PRC helps individuals every day.” Chamberlain enthuses.\n",
      "This recent grant will do so much for so many, making positive and uplifting differences in their lives.\n",
      "“We are thrilled that we can continue to expand our programs to help even more individuals and families create a pathway to navigate their way towards an independent and thriving future,” Chamberlain says.  “In many ways the PRC provides hope that many have lost, especially after those few days and weeks after a traumatic injury or event. I am personally thrilled we were evaluated on our demonstrated impact, value and positive outcomes. The PRC has helped so many families; it acts as a lifeline when their lives have changed in an instant. The grant will keep that lifeline open for those who need it the most.”\n",
      "Chamberlain sums up the mission of the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation perfectly: “We not only are giving helpful tools (to clients), we are giving hope.”\n",

      "By Elsie WalkerThirty-five years ago, Terry Cook Delahaya USA in Chester started a car show that turned into an event like no other: Lead East, known as the world’s biggest ‘50’s party. The event grew to become a journey back in time to the music, dance, movies, and sights of the 1950s.\n",
      "After the last Lead East, Cook decided to retire to write a book. However, the party isn’t over. Four longtime Lead East attendees from the Hope area have taken ownership of the event and Jim Craig of Great Meadows has become event coordinator. With these changes, Lead East still features an abundance of classic cars, but it is morphing from a party into a festival of the 1950s, with more offerings for kids than in the past. Classic cars are still a big part of it, as is the spirit of giving. Lead East will run from Thursday, Aug. 30 to Sunday, Sept. 2 at the Parsippany Hilton.\n",
      "“We want to open the door to more generations and introduce other generations to the ‘50’s,” explained Craig. He compares attending Lead East to being beamed up to a spaceship and taken back in time. Things were different then. “In the ‘50s, everything was American; it was an American phenomenon,” he said.\n",
      "Lead East has always had the sounds of rock and roll bands and accapella do-wop groups, the look of ‘50s fashion like poodle skirts and greased back hair, plus a traditional prom and even Elvis sightings. Now, it is offering more for not only those who remember the ‘50s, but those experiencing it for the first time.\n",
      "Craig shared that people can learn about how to dress like the ‘50’s or to decorate their home ‘50’’s style. Country line dancing has been added to the dance lesson offerings. Craig noted that classic country was also part of the ‘50’s. For kids there will be Craigles the clown, a clown mobile, a flea circus, face painting, balloon animals and contests.  A model making contest will be open to both boys and girls, in two different age groups. The children will be supplied with model car kits and judged on who does best at putting one together. Another contest for kids is to see who can get the best greaser (greaser down hair) look.\n",
      "Of course, Lead East wouldn’t be Lead East without cars with 1,400 plus cars expected to arrive by Friday of the event. They come from not only New Jersey, but a variety of states. Also, they’re not all from the ‘50s. There will be cars from the 1930s – 1970s: classics, rot rods, muscle cars and more.\n",
      "One aspect of Lead East is that of giving. Every year, Lead East picks a charity to support and this year it is the Ashley-Lauren Foundation which helps children in N.J. who have cancer. There will be a booth at which 50/50 tickets will be sold.\n",
      "Also, as it has been for many years, Piccatinny Arsenal, from Dover, will be on hand showing some of its military vehicles and collecting toys for Toys for Tots to be given out to needy area children at Christmas. The Parsippany police and fire departments are also expected to be on hand with vehicles and taking donations.\n",

      "With teen suicide on the rise throughout the state, Senator Richard Codey (D-Livingston), recently unveiled a $1 million plan to combat depression and help educate people on mental health.\n",
      "On July 1, the former governor introduced a bill that will award a $1 million grant within the NJ Department of Education (DOE) for school districts to hire mental health counselors.\n",
      "The NJ Department of Health will determine which school districts are awarded grants. The DOE will report on progress by 2021. There will be specialized training workshops to non-licensed, auxiliary school staff who interact with students and a creation of a statewide “Teen Suicide and Depression Task Force” charged with developing additional methods to combat teen suicide and depression and report back to the state legislature by July 2019.\n",
      "“School workers such as secretaries, security guards and teacher’s aides need the tools and training to recognize bullying, early warning signs and symptoms of mental health issues, and the proper steps to resolve conflict and prevent potential disasters,” declared Governor Codey at a press conference at Liberty Middle School in West Orange in May.\n",
      "According to the New Jersey Youth Suicide Report, 2,731 people age 10 to 24 were treated in an emergency room for non-fatal suicide attempts/self-inflicted injuries from 2013 to 2015. Also, according to the New Jersey Dept. of Health, from 2007 to 2016, suicides among children ages 10 to 18 rose by 16.6 percent.\n",
      "“Too many young lives are being lost,” Codey said at the press conference. “New Jersey must act now to better equip all school employees to help identify at-risk students and prevent teen suicides and other mental health related incidents in their schools.”\n",
      "Codey and his wife, Mary Jo Codey, have been involved with mental health since 2012 when they established the Codey Fund for Mental Health. The organization’s goal is to educate people about mental health and provide quality treatment for individuals with mental illness.\n",
      "Mary Jo has dealt with depression and Codey has met with many parents who have lost kids to suicide, including Dianne Grossman of Rockaway, whose daughter Mallory took her own life at age 12 in June 2017 and Rachelle St. Phard, whose son Coby committed suicide in March 2016 at age 18.\n",
      "The governor has been surrounded by death most of his life. He is the owner of Codey and Jones Funeral Home in Caldwell, but noted that he has never seen so saw many young people die until recently.\n",
      "Codey feels that social media is a huge factor in teen depression and suicide. Instead of being outside with friends or being active, bullying follows kids home onto Snapchat, Twitter or Facebook, making their lives even worse, he said.\n",
      "With the recent suicides of designer Kate Spade and renowned chef, Anthony Bourdain, depression can affect anyone, he said. The governor hopes these deaths may get people to talk about depression.“The biggest thing for mental health is to overcome the stigma of depression,” he said. “Teenage suicide is not a comfortable issue for people to talk about.”Governor Cody Aims To Prevent Teen Suicide added by new_view_media on July 18, 2018View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Unveiled earlier this year after several years of planning, the Center for Nursing Innovation and Research (CNIR) for Morristown Medical Center (MMC) is providing greater research and innovation.\n",
      "MMC holds the American Nurses Credentialing Center’s (ANCC) designation of a “magnet facility;” inspired by the ANCC requirement for its “magnet recognition program,” a formal plan to expand innovation and research resources via a specialized nursing center evolved. With support from the Women’s Association for MMC, the organizers were able to realize their vision this year.\n",
      "“We are grateful to the Women’s Association for MMC for the funding to support the CNIR,” said Carol Jones, chief nursing officer of MMC. “Within ten months of receiving funding the new space was built and utilized.”\n",
      "According to Jones, the primary goal of CNIR will be “improving patient and family outcomes related to the health and well-being of individuals.” This design will be accomplished by utilizing CNIR’s research capacity to find improvements in healthcare, researching best practices or by exploring innovative changes in care delivery. PhD-prepped nurses will be spearheading all research and innovative\n",
      "endeavors at the center.\n",
      "According to Jones, one benefit of the CNIR is more flexible scheduling. For example, two formal education programs for research and innovation are held annually at MMC; the classes now take place at the CNIR, facilitating participation.\n",
      "Additionally, the CNIR will hold classes highlighting new perspectives leading to innovations in the fall. An Evidence-based Scholar Program is also now held at the center.\n",
      "Jones pointed out the various ways that the CNIR will serve the diverse needs of nurses.\n",
      "“Frequently, there is a research component associated with academic studies,” said Jones. Nurses who are required to conduct research for academic purposes [can do so at CNIR], and seek guidance from nurse researchers at the center. Other nurses seek to learn about the evaluation of existing evidence or how to generate new\n",
      "knowledge through research.”\n",
      "The CNIR is open to any nurse working at Morristown Medical Center, and no special requirements are needed to meet with the nurse researchers about new ideas or research projects.\n",
      "“Motivated nurses are welcome and encouraged to utilize the resources and space!” Jones stated, adding that the formal classes on Evidence-based Practice and Innovation require an application due to limited class size.\n",
      "According to Jones, in the short period of time since the CNIR’s opening, nurses and physicians have provided favorable feedback. The frequent use of the space, including use by interprofessional teams for concept exploration and assistance planning studies has demonstrated the need for and desirability of the center.\n",
      "Additionally, members of the non-medical community who have seen the CNIR have shared their enthusiasm for nursing activities with Jones and her colleagues.\n",
      "Expressing hope that use of the center will continue to evolve and grow, Jones stated that nursing leadership at MMC will perhaps engage members of the community and area organizations, such as the Women’s Association for Morristown Medical Center, to collaborate on efforts of how to best serve the community.\n",
      "“Serving the community, as well as improving patient outcomes, are goals of the Atlantic Health System and Morristown Medical Center,” Jones said. “Nurse leaders at Morristown Medical Center have always been innovators!”New Medical Center Aims To Encourage Nursing Innovation added by new_view_media on August 22, 2018View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Congratulations! The college process is over! The applying, the application fees, the running around for recommendation letters. It’s all over. Now the whole family is probably running to the nearest Bed Bath and Beyond trying to find which comforter is the most “aesthetically pleasing” to the ideal dream college dorm. Before running for those necessities, come back to reality and realize that this isn’t the end of the worry.\n",
      "For most families, how much money college will cost is top priority because as years continue, the prices for schools climb. Have no fear, here are some ways for soon to be college students to save and make money to help them keep college costs as low as possible.\n",
      "Apply for federal work study Federal Work Study is a program most schools have in which students receive a job through the student employment office. The money that the student earns does not go toward their tuition but instead goes to the student as cash during the semester. Depending on the school, they allow students a certain amount of money to earn. Mary Primich of Trenton, a sophomore at\n",
      "Monmouth University double majoring in secondary education and English, works on campus at Pollak Theater through federal work study.\n",
      "“It’s hard getting a job when you’re in school,” she says. “It’s cool how we’re able to work on campus throughout the semester and get paid for it. I use a little bit of it for day to day expenses and then the other half I save some of it to pay off my loans.”\n",
      "Federal work study is also a great way for students to get involved with their school as well as making money.\n",
      "Apply for EOF\n",
      "EOF (Educational Opportunity Fund), is a scholarship that allows New Jersey students to receive a well-rounded education that they normally would not be able to afford. Given to those students more than capable of doing great things after college, chosen applicants are given full admission to the university that they attend, financial support, and services throughout the year to help them succeed during their next four years.\n",
      "Arina Martin of Jackson, a sophomore at Monmouth University majoring in music, is one EOF\n",
      "scholarship recipient. She states “EOF has given me the opportunity to go to college when I couldn’t afford it. Without it (EOF), I’m not sure if I would have been able to go to a university.”\n",
      "Be sure to check out the school’s website for their EOF program or call the school’s EOF department for requirements in seeking this financial help.\n",
      "Staying at home for school isn’t always bad\n",
      "Community college saves students money on food, room and board as well as other expenses such as room décor and transportation.\n",
      "Kassidy Orzechowski of Clifton, who recently transferred from Monmouth to go to Bergen Community College explains “I was supposed to go to Montclair but Montclair suggested I go to\n",
      "my local community college because getting your associates degree counts as having your general education requirements completed, so it makes more sense and it’s cheaper.”\n",
      "Although some may look down upon going to a community college, many would agree that these students are making a wise choice as the cost difference between a community college and a university is evident.Orzechowski explains, “I’m paying $2,500 to be a full-time student this semester instead of $16,000+ a semester. If I did this a year ago I’d be in a better position because no matter what all of my credits would have transferred so I’d be in a better position.”\n",
      "Sell old clothes to a local thrift store\n",
      "Selling items and clothing that the student no longer uses anymore is a perfect way to not only save and make money, but to help the student determine what items are important versus completely irrelevant. By selling clothes at stores such as Platos Closet in Ledgewood, a recycling store that allows customers to sell gently used clothes for cash and other items that they do not use, the student can save space in the car for move in day and make some extra cash.\n",
      "Bryanna Welch of Long Branch, a sophomore at Monmouth University majoring in sociology, endeavors in shopping at thrift stores.\n",
      "She states “If we are comparing goodwill to Urban Outfitters, then I would be saving so much money. Usually I compare quality and cleanliness of the clothing itself. I like good will because it\n",
      "helps out charities.”\n",
      "Summer jobs\n",
      "Summer jobs are a necessity for all college students. Considering there are three months of summer for the average college kid, there is more than enough time to get a job at any restaurant, movie theater or a bowling alley in order to start saving. Summer camps are perfect\n",
      "places to work over the summer because not only do people get paid for being a little kid, but they get to catch some sun rays. Carolyn Welch of Long Branch, a sophomore at Monmouth University, says “Summer jobs are the way to go for college kids. You get bored in the summer anyways, so why not make some money!” Welch advises to incoming freshmen to “Get a job for the summer before you go to college and save up money for the first semester for whatever it is they want to spend it on whether it be going out to eat or shopping. If you receive any money for Christmas, be sure to save it up for the next semester and file for tax returns in March!”\n",

      "“Today’s Care, Tomorrow’s cure:” This is the inspiring mission of the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation.\n",
      "On July 1, the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation in Short Hills received a three year, 6.5 million dollar federal grant to help people who are living with spinal cord injuries and other conditions that cause paralysis. Some of these conditions include spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, (ALS), stroke, spina bifida and cerebral palsy. This money will aid these people in\n",
      "the many battles and challenges they face on a daily basis, enhancing their lives.\n",
      "The foundation is the recipient of the National Paralysis Resource Center cooperative agreement from the Administration for Community Living.   The Reeve Foundation has operated the Paralysis Resource Center (PRC) for approximately 16 years.\n",
      "Quality of life: Everyone strives to obtain it, the enjoyment and independence that make life worth living. So many people take it for granted.  But having quality of life is often difficult, if not nearly impossible, when people have physical disabilities impeding their way.\n",
      "But those from the Short Hills based Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation seek to change that. Their belief is simple: That every human being should be able to obtain and lead full and rich lives, regardless of their physical condition. They have an unwavering conviction that every human being deserves a life filled with\n",
      "dignity.\n",
      "Both Christopher and Dana Reeve were staunch advocates and champions for the disabled. After his horse riding accident that left him paralyzed in 1995, actor Christopher Reeve put a human and familiar face on those who are enduring spinal cord injuries and paralysis.  No more could people pretend that it was just an\n",
      "anonymous person who was suffering with a disability: Reeve was famous, and had been considered synonymous with Superman!  But he was more than just a celebrity or a figurehead.  He and his wife Dana were activists, driven to create positive changes. Utterly passionate regarding helping these fellow courageous folks living with physical challenges, Reeve simply considered them heroes. He\n",
      "staunchly sought to give them hope, because he knew how easily they could feel hopeless.\n",
      "A staggering 1 in 50 people in the United States, approximately 5.4 million Americans live with paralysis of some kind. And those aren’t just numbers or statistics; they are people close to us. “We all know someone a brother, sister, friend, neighbor or colleague who is suffering with paralysis. They aren’t strangers. They are one degree of separation from all of us,” officials assert.\n",
      "The Reeves’ Foundation is dedicated to performing innovative research, securing grants, providing information and much needed advocacy to aid their clients.\n",
      "During the past 16 years and moving forward, The Reeve Foundation and National Paralysis Resource Center continue to compete in a rigorous bidding process for every three years’ worth of funding, but the results for their clients are golden.\n",
      "Since it opened in 2002, 100,000 people have been aided by this organization with approximately 20,000 people helped in the past three years alone.\n",
      "According to Anna Chamberlain, supervisor of Marketing and Communications for the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation since 2015, the Reeve Foundation has a dual mission.\n",
      "“We focus on creating resources and programs to help the 5.4 million Americans and their families impacted by paralysis though our Paralysis Resource Center while also funding innovative and cutting edge research to find cures for spinal cord injuries in the near future,” she explains.\n",
      "Offering a multitude of free services such as their peer program which offers a way of connecting individuals and caregivers with respective peer mentors to offer much needed emotional support, their military veterans program, information specialists, quality of life grants, program advocacy, and policy programs, these resources are designed to aid the whole individual.  They empower both the body and spirit, to help to navigate the insecure journey ahead.\n",
      "“The programs help individuals return to actively participating in their communities, achieving independence and self-sufficiency, achieving things we take for granted like learning how to drive again, going back to work and even leaving their own homes are also ways in which the PRC helps individuals every day.” Chamberlain enthuses.\n",
      "This recent grant will do so much for so many, making positive and uplifting differences in their lives.\n",
      "“We are thrilled that we can continue to expand our programs to help even more individuals and families create a pathway to navigate their way towards an independent and thriving future,” Chamberlain says.  “In many ways the PRC provides hope that many have lost, especially after those few days and weeks after a traumatic injury or event. I am personally thrilled we were evaluated on our demonstrated impact, value and positive outcomes. The PRC has helped so many families; it acts as a lifeline when their lives have changed in an instant. The grant will keep that lifeline open for those who need it the most.”\n",
      "Chamberlain sums up the mission of the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation perfectly: “We not only are giving helpful tools (to clients), we are giving hope.”\n",

      "By Elsie WalkerThirty-five years ago, Terry Cook Delahaya USA in Chester started a car show that turned into an event like no other: Lead East, known as the world’s biggest ‘50’s party. The event grew to become a journey back in time to the music, dance, movies, and sights of the 1950s.\n",
      "After the last Lead East, Cook decided to retire to write a book. However, the party isn’t over. Four longtime Lead East attendees from the Hope area have taken ownership of the event and Jim Craig of Great Meadows has become event coordinator. With these changes, Lead East still features an abundance of classic cars, but it is morphing from a party into a festival of the 1950s, with more offerings for kids than in the past. Classic cars are still a big part of it, as is the spirit of giving. Lead East will run from Thursday, Aug. 30 to Sunday, Sept. 2 at the Parsippany Hilton.\n",
      "“We want to open the door to more generations and introduce other generations to the ‘50’s,” explained Craig. He compares attending Lead East to being beamed up to a spaceship and taken back in time. Things were different then. “In the ‘50s, everything was American; it was an American phenomenon,” he said.\n",
      "Lead East has always had the sounds of rock and roll bands and accapella do-wop groups, the look of ‘50s fashion like poodle skirts and greased back hair, plus a traditional prom and even Elvis sightings. Now, it is offering more for not only those who remember the ‘50s, but those experiencing it for the first time.\n",
      "Craig shared that people can learn about how to dress like the ‘50’s or to decorate their home ‘50’’s style. Country line dancing has been added to the dance lesson offerings. Craig noted that classic country was also part of the ‘50’s. For kids there will be Craigles the clown, a clown mobile, a flea circus, face painting, balloon animals and contests.  A model making contest will be open to both boys and girls, in two different age groups. The children will be supplied with model car kits and judged on who does best at putting one together. Another contest for kids is to see who can get the best greaser (greaser down hair) look.\n",
      "Of course, Lead East wouldn’t be Lead East without cars with 1,400 plus cars expected to arrive by Friday of the event. They come from not only New Jersey, but a variety of states. Also, they’re not all from the ‘50s. There will be cars from the 1930s – 1970s: classics, rot rods, muscle cars and more.\n",
      "One aspect of Lead East is that of giving. Every year, Lead East picks a charity to support and this year it is the Ashley-Lauren Foundation which helps children in N.J. who have cancer. There will be a booth at which 50/50 tickets will be sold.\n",
      "Also, as it has been for many years, Piccatinny Arsenal, from Dover, will be on hand showing some of its military vehicles and collecting toys for Toys for Tots to be given out to needy area children at Christmas. The Parsippany police and fire departments are also expected to be on hand with vehicles and taking donations.\n",

      "With teen suicide on the rise throughout the state, Senator Richard Codey (D-Livingston), recently unveiled a $1 million plan to combat depression and help educate people on mental health.\n",
      "On July 1, the former governor introduced a bill that will award a $1 million grant within the NJ Department of Education (DOE) for school districts to hire mental health counselors.\n",
      "The NJ Department of Health will determine which school districts are awarded grants. The DOE will report on progress by 2021. There will be specialized training workshops to non-licensed, auxiliary school staff who interact with students and a creation of a statewide “Teen Suicide and Depression Task Force” charged with developing additional methods to combat teen suicide and depression and report back to the state legislature by July 2019.\n",
      "“School workers such as secretaries, security guards and teacher’s aides need the tools and training to recognize bullying, early warning signs and symptoms of mental health issues, and the proper steps to resolve conflict and prevent potential disasters,” declared Governor Codey at a press conference at Liberty Middle School in West Orange in May.\n",
      "According to the New Jersey Youth Suicide Report, 2,731 people age 10 to 24 were treated in an emergency room for non-fatal suicide attempts/self-inflicted injuries from 2013 to 2015. Also, according to the New Jersey Dept. of Health, from 2007 to 2016, suicides among children ages 10 to 18 rose by 16.6 percent.\n",
      "“Too many young lives are being lost,” Codey said at the press conference. “New Jersey must act now to better equip all school employees to help identify at-risk students and prevent teen suicides and other mental health related incidents in their schools.”\n",
      "Codey and his wife, Mary Jo Codey, have been involved with mental health since 2012 when they established the Codey Fund for Mental Health. The organization’s goal is to educate people about mental health and provide quality treatment for individuals with mental illness.\n",
      "Mary Jo has dealt with depression and Codey has met with many parents who have lost kids to suicide, including Dianne Grossman of Rockaway, whose daughter Mallory took her own life at age 12 in June 2017 and Rachelle St. Phard, whose son Coby committed suicide in March 2016 at age 18.\n",
      "The governor has been surrounded by death most of his life. He is the owner of Codey and Jones Funeral Home in Caldwell, but noted that he has never seen so saw many young people die until recently.\n",
      "Codey feels that social media is a huge factor in teen depression and suicide. Instead of being outside with friends or being active, bullying follows kids home onto Snapchat, Twitter or Facebook, making their lives even worse, he said.\n",
      "With the recent suicides of designer Kate Spade and renowned chef, Anthony Bourdain, depression can affect anyone, he said. The governor hopes these deaths may get people to talk about depression.“The biggest thing for mental health is to overcome the stigma of depression,” he said. “Teenage suicide is not a comfortable issue for people to talk about.”Governor Cody Aims To Prevent Teen Suicide added by new_view_media on July 18, 2018View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Many in the Morristown community and beyond knew Myles Mislavsky (Morristown High School – Class of 2013). His smile was contagious and his friendliness was well-known. To honor his life, his family – Hector Mislavsky, Judy Martinez and Jessie Mislavsky – has created a college-debt forgiveness fund – the Myles Smiled on You Award – for Morristown High School alumni to be administered by the Morris Educational Foundation. The award, for secondary education loan reduction, will be given to deserving MHS alumni who exemplify Myles’ many positive characteristics. It was created to reduce the burden of debt many students carry after college making it hard for them to save and get ahead. The award is funded by family, friends and the Golden Bagel Runners who knew and loved Myles. Myles was an amazing human being. Witty, charismatic, giving and loyal…these words merely scratch the surface in describing Myles. He made a lasting impact on the lives of those around him and was committed to helping others. He radiated joy with a smile so infectious that even on your worst days, he lifted your spirit. People were drawn to Myles and were better having known him. The award application is open to all Morristown High School alumni – Class of 2009 and after – who have graduated from a college, university or trade school (2 or 4 year) and have student loans. In 2019, this scholarship will be awarded to multiple alumni who graduated after 2009, at least one of whom graduated with Myles in 2013. In addition to demonstrating college debt burden, the award application requires 3 – 250 word or less essays: how have you dealt with challenging situations (mental or physical health, or other) and how did you or are you dealing with those challenges; describe how you have demonstrated empathy toward others; and what do you do to help your family/community, as well as a letter of recommendation. “We are honored to administer the Myles Smiled On You Award on behalf of the Mislavsky/Martinez family. We are so grateful to our donors, like the Mislavskys/Martinez Family, whose generosity inspires and impacts our Morristown High School community,” said Patty Haralampoudis, the Chair of the Morris Educational Foundation. It is the hope of the Mislavsky/Martinez Family that with this financial award, Myles will “smile on” Morristown High School alumni just as he did during his amazing life. Morris Educational Foundation Announces Myles Smiled on You Award for College-Debt Forgiveness Created in honor of Myles Mislavsky  added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "By Dawn M Chiossi  Morristown High School Graduate Amelia Langan has certainly been busy. Thanks to her recent activities in raising awareness about organ and tissue donation, she founded a Donate Life club at her school and was one of six students awarded a scholarship for the 2019-2020 academic year from the New Jersey Sharing Network.   The New Jersey Sharing Network is committed to saving and enhancing lives through organ donation. Giving a second chance at life, organ and tissue donation does just that. Just making that one decision can save lives, and make a huge, enriching impact on the lives of others.   As Langan discovered, it can also do the same thing for the self.   Like most people, Langan became aware of the importance of organ donation only when she took her driver’s education class in school. In hearing speaker– and liver transplant recipient–Michele Dabal, she became aware of how organ donation can impact and benefit others.  “She cleared up a lot of misconceptions and concerns that people have regarding organ donation,” Langan explains. “Hearing her story on how organ donation helped her to survive really resonated with me,” Langan shares.  Langan was so inspired by Dabal, she began to do her own research regarding organ donation, about how many lives could be changed for the better. It soon became a cause she became passionate about.   “One person can save up to eight lives with organ donation, and up to fifty with tissue donation,” she enthuses.  Langan was awarded the scholarship for diligently volunteering with the New Jersey Sharing Network, devoting an impressive 80 hours to volunteering.  Additionally, she raised awareness regarding organ and tissue donation for her Girl Scout Gold Award project.    Wanting to inspire others regarding organ donation, Langan founded a Donate Life club at her high school. The club came into existence during her junior year of 2017.    Describing Morristown’s Donate Life club as a small one of approximately 20-25 members, they do so much. Members volunteer with the New Jersey Sharing Network. Additionally, the club lined up speakers for people to hear inspiring stories regarding their organ and tissue donations.  For Langan, the goal was to get people talking about organ donation and to start a conversation about it. The club did this in a variety of ways.   “This is such an easy way to make a positive impact in our country. Organ donation affects everyone everywhere (even globally). It is so widespread,” she asserts. Through her passion and research, Langan and the club discovered that in Morristown alone, approximately 21 people were on the list looking for a transplant. “Everyone knows someone affected.”  Although Langan is a Freshman at Boston’s Northeastern University and is already fully committed to majoring in behavioral neuroscience and minoring in biochemistry to go into the field of research for cancer, she still is helping in the cause close to her heart. She has extended the parameters of the club, creating a video explaining and inspiring other high school students how they can help in the cause of organ donation and create a Donate Life club of their own.  Langan’s excitement to inspire others to make a difference through organ and tissue donation has even extended to her sister and her sister’s best friend. Both are going to take up the mantle of Morristown’s Donate Life club, to put their own ideas to it.   For Langan, everything is connected and stems from the information and inspiration she received from Driver’s Ed class. “I was so surprised to receive the scholarship,” she shares. “I didn’t think I had a chance of winning. It was Michele who persuaded me to apply. If I hadn’t met her, I wouldn’t have been inspired to do any of this. It wasn’t just me, (being awarded the scholarship or success of the club) so many people were a beacon of encouragement. From Michele, to Brooke, and Daniel Sarnowski at New Jersey Sharing Network, to so many others behind the scenes. I’m very grateful.”Changing the World, Raising Awareness About Organ and Tissue Donation, Morristown Grad Founds Donate Life Club, Wins Scholarship added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "By: Jason Cohen Swimming runs in the blood of Jack Alexy. All of his siblings are swimmers, but he will be the first to have the chance to be in the Olympics. In June 2020, the Mendham resident will be competing against 1500 people in the Olympic Trials for swimming in Omaha, Neb. “I’m not going to know how it feels until I’m there,” Alexy said. “I know I’m definitely going to be nervous.” Alexy, 16, is a junior at Delbarton School in Morristown and has been swimming for the Somerset Hills YMCA Swim team in Basking Ridge since he was 8. After watching his older siblings Kate, 20, and Max, 18, swim; he quickly fell in love with the sport and followed in their footsteps. While his parents Lynn and Matt were not swimmers, they felt it was important for their children to learn. Their younger brother, Rob, 15, also swims.“My parents just wanted all of their kids to know how to swim for safety,” Alexy explained. Alexy said Kate and Max had a big influence on him. Swimming brought them closer and they taught him to never give up and always stay calm. In fact, Kate swims at Kenyon College in Ohio and Alexy hopes to swim in college as well. Alexy also played basketball, but quit in eighth grade to focus on swimming.He started to realize he had a future in swimming three years ago when he made the YMCA Nationals team. After that, he made nationals the next three years.Today swimming is a huge part of his life. He practices six days a week for two hours a day and has a few dry practices as well. In fact, he met some of his best friends from swimming.“That’s one of the best things about swimming, the people and the bonds,” he commented. In 2016 Lori Riegler took over as his coach. Over the past few years they have gotten close and she has helped him become a better swimmer. Alexy knows he has a long road ahead as he prepares for the Olympic Trials. He qualified for the 50 and 100 meter freestyle and in order to make the Olympics has to finish top two in an event. Right now he trains by swimming 25 yards, but in the trials it is 50 meters. So, in February, he will change his to 50. “It’s pretty crazy,” he said. “I still got a lot of work to do before then.”In August, he had a bit of a preview of what it will be like at the trials when he participated in the World Junior Championships in Budapest, Hungary. It was his first intentional competition. “It’s (Olympic Trials) definitely special,’ he said. “I got a little taste of that over the summer in Budapest.” Mendham Resident to Compete in Olympic Trials for Swimming  added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "By: Elise Phillips Margulis  Mendham-based artist Jeff Gould, known for his stunning fine art landscapes and abstract Surrealistic compositions, is having an  exhibition called “Views from Schiff” which will feature paintings directly from and inspired by Schiff Nature Preserve in Mendham.  Gould will be showing his “nature and animal surreal mashups” as well. The exhibit will also include Japanese-inspired artwork by artist Al Gunther www.dragonflystudios-algunther.com.” The “Views from Schiff” exhibit will be on October 5th from 4:00 to 6:00 p.m. at the Alhamra Gallery and Art Center in Bernardsville. Blues legend Barry Blues will play a music set and refreshments will be served. The entertainment and food are free. Some of the proceeds will go to Schiff Nature Preserve. Gould hails from New Rochelle, NY. He recalls being “artistic at a very early age and copying cartoons out of the newspaper, including Charlie Brown for a piece of promotional material for my kindergarten class.” He drew “Mad Magazine” characters when he was a bit older. Gould also enjoyed drawing superheroes. Some of his favorite artists and inspirations are Mort Drucker and Don Martin. Gould’s biggest childhood artist influence was Norman Rockwell. “I used to sit down for hours with pencil and paper trying to copy his paintings,” shared Gould.  “Oddly, we seem to occupy the same towns. From growing up in New Rochelle where he lived, to spending summers in the Berkshires where his main studio was.” Gould added, “And now I live in the Schiff on Rockwell Court which was named after him because he had a studio here and painted some of the early covers of the Boy Scout manuals!” After Gould graduated from University of the Arts in Philadelphia, he designed toys for a company in New York. Then he designed packaging for the pharmaceutical industry. His next position was Art Director and then Marketing Director in the Midwest. Gould’s wife, Karen, is from northwest Indiana on the Chicago side. After they were married they lived in different areas of the United States and in Canada. When Karen accepted a job at AT&T in 2001, they “fell in love with this area.”  Gould decided to become a stay-at-home dad and work as a freelancer doing illustration, graphic design and portraits when his children were born.  “I always loved the masters like Da Vinci and Rubens. Rockwell and Maxfield Parish were also some of my favorites. I also loved the French impressionists and nature and started doing oils, mainly for fun.” He was able to achieve his dream of having his work hang in homes and galleries as his children got older. Once they were more self-sufficient he immersed himself into painting his own masterpieces. Living in the Brookrace subdivision of Schiff enables him to explore the gorgeous nature preserve daily. “I walk my dog on the many trails every day of the year. I am never at a loss for the beauty that nature provides.”  In addition to enjoying Schiff, Gould noted, “My wife and I love hiking and scuba diving and nature in general. And trying to communicate that beauty with a paintbrush is my passion.” Gould won the Award of Excellence from The Center for Contemporary Art in Bernardsville for his “Schiff Meadow #2” painting over the summer.  Gould invites you to attend his October 5th Gallery Exhibit to enjoy his vibrant surrealistic painting, blues music and delicious food. A portion of the proceeds will be donated to the Schiff. The Alhamra Gallery & Art Center is located at 21 Clairmont Rd, Bernardsville. Mendham Artist Will Exhibit Paintings at Alhamra Gallery & Art Center in Bernardsville on October 5 added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "By Dawn M Chiossi  Going on since February of this year, Hackettstown’s Heath Village inspires their staff with its English Language Program.   This program is a class format, an offshoot of the Adult English Language Tutoring Program sponsored by the Literacy New Jersey Sussex Branch. This program is for any adult in Sussex or Warren Counties, who would like to improve their facility with English– making them more comfortable speaking English.    It has been said that education is a great equalizer. It opens doors to everyone; it stirs curiosity, accesses information, and lets the mind ponder, inquire and enjoy.   The English Language Program is spearheaded and run by two-year Heath Village resident, Marguerite Gadel, as well as Susan Sumner. Gadel explains that the program works with the State and Local Literacy New Jersey Organization’s Sussex Branch (a branch that expands to Warren County.)  Gadel herself had been a part of the literacy organization for an impressive 20 years.   Although relatively new, Heath Village’s program is an informal, inclusive one. It focuses mainly on spoken communication, conversational English, and some grammar and spelling.  Concentrating on how to be comfortable speaking English, students will learn enough to communicate easily in functional areas such as making appointments or filling out forms. The program seeks to make communications easier and much more fluid, both in work and social situations.   Additionally, the class will make it more enjoyable for students to follow a TV program or read a book. “I want them to really enjoy reading in English,” Gadel shares.   “There’s even some students in the class who are taking their test for citizenship. That’s a big job,” she prides.  Gadel explains that she came up with the idea of starting the program soon after she moved to Heath Village.   Immediately proposing the idea to Heath Village’s CEO to make the program available, and receiving an overwhelmingly positive response, she set to work.   Wanting the English Language Program to be engaging and relatable for the students, the program involves them right away by having them read out loud. “We try to jump on something of interest to the students or go over something from the week before that they had learned,” Gadel explains.    For these students, learning English is not a chore, but a pleasure.  Gadel can’t say enough about her students in general, admiring their determination and hard work ethic. “They come to class completely on their own time. Usually after working a full day. Then they’ll have to go home, take care of their families and do homework. It’s so impressive that they are willing to put in the time and effort to do this,” she enthuses.  They will even find creative ways to learn. For example, Gadel relates that one of her students will watch the news without subtitles to learn what is going on.  For Gadel, just the small act of using her talents to make a difference in the lives of others has created a ripple effect. “I love seeing the students help each other,” she says. “For instance, a student from Mexico will help someone from Colombia. It is wonderful to see that happen. It is thrilling to see them put in so much effort and work so hard to learn.”  Gadel sees with her own eyes how much of an impact the program is making to her students. They are not only learning but enjoying. What’s more, they are sharing that feeling and connection with others.  “I remember when the class discovered that Heath Village had a new resident, a lady from England who had been in England’s Royal Air Force (R.A.F.) in World War II,” Gadel shares. “A student had recently read an article to us regarding the R.A.F. Because of that, the class eagerly wanted to talk to this lady and ask her questions. They were so involved, asking about her experiences and how they were different in England as opposed to here in America. It was wonderful.”  The Literacy New Jersey Sussex Branch will be training new volunteers to be tutors beginning in late September.  Training for new tutors is offered in the spring and the fall. It is ideal for someone who would like to make a difference, no experience is necessary.  Training consists of three in-person meetings interspersed with online training. The first session is especially useful in helping people decide whether or not they would like to do the tutoring. “I would love to encourage some people to train for this great volunteer work. We always have waiting students,” Gadel enthuses. For further information or details on tutoring, please contact Literacy New Jersey Sussex County Office at 973-300-9444 or by visiting www.literacynj.orgHackettstown’s Heath Village Inspires Staff with English Language Program added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Unveiled earlier this year after several years of planning, the Center for Nursing Innovation and Research (CNIR) for Morristown Medical Center (MMC) is providing greater research and innovation.\n",
      "MMC holds the American Nurses Credentialing Center’s (ANCC) designation of a “magnet facility;” inspired by the ANCC requirement for its “magnet recognition program,” a formal plan to expand innovation and research resources via a specialized nursing center evolved. With support from the Women’s Association for MMC, the organizers were able to realize their vision this year.\n",
      "“We are grateful to the Women’s Association for MMC for the funding to support the CNIR,” said Carol Jones, chief nursing officer of MMC. “Within ten months of receiving funding the new space was built and utilized.”\n",
      "According to Jones, the primary goal of CNIR will be “improving patient and family outcomes related to the health and well-being of individuals.” This design will be accomplished by utilizing CNIR’s research capacity to find improvements in healthcare, researching best practices or by exploring innovative changes in care delivery. PhD-prepped nurses will be spearheading all research and innovative\n",
      "endeavors at the center.\n",
      "According to Jones, one benefit of the CNIR is more flexible scheduling. For example, two formal education programs for research and innovation are held annually at MMC; the classes now take place at the CNIR, facilitating participation.\n",
      "Additionally, the CNIR will hold classes highlighting new perspectives leading to innovations in the fall. An Evidence-based Scholar Program is also now held at the center.\n",
      "Jones pointed out the various ways that the CNIR will serve the diverse needs of nurses.\n",
      "“Frequently, there is a research component associated with academic studies,” said Jones. Nurses who are required to conduct research for academic purposes [can do so at CNIR], and seek guidance from nurse researchers at the center. Other nurses seek to learn about the evaluation of existing evidence or how to generate new\n",
      "knowledge through research.”\n",
      "The CNIR is open to any nurse working at Morristown Medical Center, and no special requirements are needed to meet with the nurse researchers about new ideas or research projects.\n",
      "“Motivated nurses are welcome and encouraged to utilize the resources and space!” Jones stated, adding that the formal classes on Evidence-based Practice and Innovation require an application due to limited class size.\n",
      "According to Jones, in the short period of time since the CNIR’s opening, nurses and physicians have provided favorable feedback. The frequent use of the space, including use by interprofessional teams for concept exploration and assistance planning studies has demonstrated the need for and desirability of the center.\n",
      "Additionally, members of the non-medical community who have seen the CNIR have shared their enthusiasm for nursing activities with Jones and her colleagues.\n",
      "Expressing hope that use of the center will continue to evolve and grow, Jones stated that nursing leadership at MMC will perhaps engage members of the community and area organizations, such as the Women’s Association for Morristown Medical Center, to collaborate on efforts of how to best serve the community.\n",
      "“Serving the community, as well as improving patient outcomes, are goals of the Atlantic Health System and Morristown Medical Center,” Jones said. “Nurse leaders at Morristown Medical Center have always been innovators!”New Medical Center Aims To Encourage Nursing Innovation added by new_view_media on August 22, 2018View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

Now the whole family is probably running to the nearest Bed Bath and Beyond trying to find which comforter is the most “aesthetically pleasing” to the ideal dream college dorm. Before running for those necessities, come back to reality and realize that this isn’t the end of the worry.\n",
      "For most families, how much money college will cost is top priority because as years continue, the prices for schools climb. Have no fear, here are some ways for soon to be college students to save and make money to help them keep college costs as low as possible.\n",
      "Apply for federal work study Federal Work Study is a program most schools have in which students receive a job through the student employment office.

      "“It’s hard getting a job when you’re in school,” she says. “It’s cool how we’re able to work on campus throughout the semester and get paid for it. I use a little bit of it for day to day expenses and then the other half I save some of it to pay off my loans.”\n",
      "Federal work study is also a great way for students to get involved with their school as well as making money.\n",
      "Apply for EOF\n",
      "EOF (Educational Opportunity Fund), is a scholarship that allows New Jersey students to receive a well-rounded education that they normally would not be able to afford. Given to those students more than capable of doing great things after college, chosen applicants are given full admission to the university that they attend, financial support, and services throughout the year to help them succeed during their next four years.\n",

      "Although some may look down upon going to a community college, many would agree that these students are making a wise choice as the cost difference between a community college and a university is evident.Orzechowski explains, “I’m paying $2,500 to be a full-time student this semester instead of $16,000+ a semester. If I did this a year ago I’d be in a better position because no matter what all of my credits would have transferred so I’d be in a better position.”\n",

      "“Today’s Care, Tomorrow’s cure:” This is the inspiring mission of the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation.\n",
      "On July 1, the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation in Short Hills received a three year, 6.5 million dollar federal grant to help people who are living with spinal cord injuries and other conditions that cause paralysis. Some of these conditions include spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, (ALS), stroke, spina bifida and cerebral palsy. This money will aid these people in\n",
      "the many battles and challenges they face on a daily basis, enhancing their lives.\n",
      "The foundation is the recipient of the National Paralysis Resource Center cooperative agreement from the Administration for Community Living.   The Reeve Foundation has operated the Paralysis Resource Center (PRC) for approximately 16 years.\n",
      "Quality of life: Everyone strives to obtain it, the enjoyment and independence that make life worth living. So many people take it for granted.  But having quality of life is often difficult, if not nearly impossible, when people have physical disabilities impeding their way.\n",
      "But those from the Short Hills based Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation seek to change that. Their belief is simple: That every human being should be able to obtain and lead full and rich lives, regardless of their physical condition. They have an unwavering conviction that every human being deserves a life filled with\n",
      "dignity.\n",
      "Both Christopher and Dana Reeve were staunch advocates and champions for the disabled.

      "anonymous person who was suffering with a disability: Reeve was famous, and had been considered synonymous with Superman!  But he was more than just a celebrity or a figurehead.  He and his wife Dana were activists, driven to create positive changes. Utterly passionate regarding helping these fellow courageous folks living with physical challenges, Reeve simply considered them heroes. He\n",
      "staunchly sought to give them hope, because he knew how easily they could feel hopeless.\n",
      "A staggering 1 in 50 people in the United States, approximately 5.4 million Americans live with paralysis of some kind. And those aren’t just numbers or statistics; they are people close to us. “We all know someone a brother, sister, friend, neighbor or colleague who is suffering with paralysis. They aren’t strangers. They are one degree of separation from all of us,” officials assert.\n",
      "The Reeves’ Foundation is dedicated to performing innovative research, securing grants, providing information and much needed advocacy to aid their clients.\n",
      "During the past 16 years and moving forward, The Reeve Foundation and National Paralysis Resource Center continue to compete in a rigorous bidding process for every three years’ worth of funding, but the results for their clients are golden.\n",
      "Since it opened in 2002, 100,000 people have been aided by this organization with approximately 20,000 people helped in the past three years alone.\n",
      "According to Anna Chamberlain, supervisor of Marketing and Communications for the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation since 2015, the Reeve Foundation has a dual mission.\n",
      "“We focus on creating resources and programs to help the 5.4 million Americans and their families impacted by paralysis though our Paralysis Resource Center while also funding innovative and cutting edge research to find cures for spinal cord injuries in the near future,” she explains.\n",
      "Offering a multitude of free services such as their peer program which offers a way of connecting individuals and caregivers with respective peer mentors to offer much needed emotional support, their military veterans program, information specialists, quality of life grants, program advocacy, and policy programs, these resources are designed to aid the whole individual.  They empower both the body and spirit, to help to navigate the insecure journey ahead.\n",
      "“The programs help individuals return to actively participating in their communities, achieving independence and self-sufficiency, achieving things we take for granted like learning how to drive again, going back to work and even leaving their own homes are also ways in which the PRC helps individuals every day.” Chamberlain enthuses.\n",
      "This recent grant will do so much for so many, making positive and uplifting differences in their lives.\n",
      "“We are thrilled that we can continue to expand our programs to help even more individuals and families create a pathway to navigate their way towards an independent and thriving future,” Chamberlain says.  “In many ways the PRC provides hope that many have lost, especially after those few days and weeks after a traumatic injury or event. I am personally thrilled we were evaluated on our demonstrated impact, value and positive outcomes. The PRC has helped so many families; it acts as a lifeline when their lives have changed in an instant. The grant will keep that lifeline open for those who need it the most.”\n",
      "Chamberlain sums up the mission of the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation perfectly: “We not only are giving helpful tools (to clients), we are giving hope.”\n",

Four longtime Lead East attendees from the Hope area have taken ownership of the event and Jim Craig of Great Meadows has become event coordinator. With these changes, Lead East still features an abundance of classic cars, but it is morphing from a party into a festival of the 1950s, with more offerings for kids than in the past. Classic cars are still a big part of it, as is the spirit of giving. Lead East will run from Thursday, Aug. 30 to Sunday, Sept. 2 at the Parsippany Hilton.\n",
      "“We want to open the door to more generations and introduce other generations to the ‘50’s,” explained Craig. He compares attending Lead East to being beamed up to a spaceship and taken back in time. Things were different then. “In the ‘50s, everything was American; it was an American phenomenon,” he said.\n",
      "Lead East has always had the sounds of rock and roll bands and accapella do-wop groups, the look of ‘50s fashion like poodle skirts and greased back hair, plus a traditional prom and even Elvis sightings. Now, it is offering more for not only those who remember the ‘50s, but those experiencing it for the first time.\n",
      "Craig shared that people can learn about how to dress like the ‘50’s or to decorate their home ‘50’’s style. Country line dancing has been added to the dance lesson offerings. Craig noted that classic country was also part of the ‘50’s. For kids there will be Craigles the clown, a clown mobile, a flea circus, face painting, balloon animals and contests.  A model making contest will be open to both boys and girls, in two different age groups. The children will be supplied with model car kits and judged on who does best at putting one together. Another contest for kids is to see who can get the best greaser (greaser down hair) look.\n",
      "Of course, Lead East wouldn’t be Lead East without cars with 1,400 plus cars expected to arrive by Friday of the event. They come from not only New Jersey, but a variety of states. Also, they’re not all from the ‘50s. There will be cars from the 1930s – 1970s: classics, rot rods, muscle cars and more.\n",
      "One aspect of Lead East is that of giving. Every year, Lead East picks a charity to support and this year it is the Ashley-Lauren Foundation which helps children in N.J. who have cancer. There will be a booth at which 50/50 tickets will be sold.\n",
      "Also, as it has been for many years, Piccatinny Arsenal, from Dover, will be on hand showing some of its military vehicles and collecting toys for Toys for Tots to be given out to needy area children at Christmas. The Parsippany police and fire departments are also expected to be on hand with vehicles and taking donations.\n",

      "With teen suicide on the rise throughout the state, Senator Richard Codey (D-Livingston), recently unveiled a $1 million plan to combat depression and help educate people on mental health.\n",
      "On July 1, the former governor introduced a bill that will award a $1 million grant within the NJ Department of Education (DOE) for school districts to hire mental health counselors.\n",
      "The NJ Department of Health will determine which school districts are awarded grants. The DOE will report on progress by 2021. There will be specialized training workshops to non-licensed, auxiliary school staff who interact with students and a creation of a statewide “Teen Suicide and Depression Task Force” charged with developing additional methods to combat teen suicide and depression and report back to the state legislature by July 2019.\n",
      "“School workers such as secretaries, security guards and teacher’s aides need the tools and training to recognize bullying, early warning signs and symptoms of mental health issues, and the proper steps to resolve conflict and prevent potential disasters,” declared Governor Codey at a press conference at Liberty Middle School in West Orange in May.\n",
      "According to the New Jersey Youth Suicide Report, 2,731 people age 10 to 24 were treated in an emergency room for non-fatal suicide attempts/self-inflicted injuries from 2013 to 2015. Also, according to the New Jersey Dept. of Health, from 2007 to 2016, suicides among children ages 10 to 18 rose by 16.6 percent.\n",
      "“Too many young lives are being lost,” Codey said at the press conference. “New Jersey must act now to better equip all school employees to help identify at-risk students and prevent teen suicides and other mental health related incidents in their schools.”\n",
      "Codey and his wife, Mary Jo Codey, have been involved with mental health since 2012 when they established the Codey Fund for Mental Health. The organization’s goal is to educate people about mental health and provide quality treatment for individuals with mental illness.\n",
      "Mary Jo has dealt with depression and Codey has met with many parents who have lost kids to suicide, including Dianne Grossman of Rockaway, whose daughter Mallory took her own life at age 12 in June 2017 and Rachelle St. Phard, whose son Coby committed suicide in March 2016 at age 18.\n",
      "The governor has been surrounded by death most of his life. He is the owner of Codey and Jones Funeral Home in Caldwell, but noted that he has never seen so saw many young people die until recently.\n",
      "Codey feels that social media is a huge factor in teen depression and suicide. Instead of being outside with friends or being active, bullying follows kids home onto Snapchat, Twitter or Facebook, making their lives even worse, he said.\n",
      "With the recent suicides of designer Kate Spade and renowned chef, Anthony Bourdain, depression can affect anyone, he said. The governor hopes these deaths may get people to talk about depression.“The biggest thing for mental health is to overcome the stigma of depression,” he said. “Teenage suicide is not a comfortable issue for people to talk about.”Governor Cody Aims To Prevent Teen Suicide added by new_view_media on July 18, 2018View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      " Morris County Sheriff James M. Gannon has selected Kelley Zienowicz as the person to lead the Sheriff’s Office into the future. Kelley Zienowicz, a graduate of the elite FBI National Academy, will be promoted to the rank of Chief Morris County Sheriff’s Officer, the highest-level Officer position in the Sheriff’s Office Bureau of Law Enforcement. Chief Zienowicz’s promotion will formally take place on Sept. 3, 2019, during a swearing-in ceremony, making her the highest-ranking woman in the Morris County Sheriff’s Office and the sole female chief in Morris County. “I am so proud to announce the promotion of Kelley Zienowicz to Chief Sheriff’s Officer of the Morris County Sheriff’s Office,” Sheriff James M. Gannon said. “Chief Zienowicz has a temperament that motivates and energizes others. She is highly-educated, a graduate of the elite FBI National Academy, and a true leader with an impeccable work ethic.” “With Chief Zienowicz at the helm of day-to-day operations overseeing all divisions in the Sheriff’s Office Bureau of Law Enforcement, we will accomplish great things which the people of Morris County deserve,” Sheriff Gannon said.  “Not only am I proud to have the backing of the Sheriff, I know this is an important time for the agency as a whole. I hope to bring positive  motivation to the agency, from the top to the bottom,” Chief Zienowicz said. As Chief, she will be responsible for management and day-to-day oversight over the Bureau of Law Enforcement’s four divisions: Support Services, Protective Services, Legal Services, and Special Services, which includes the Crime Lab and Crime Scene Investigation Unit. Chief Zienowicz – who has received multiple awards, including the New Jersey Women in Law Enforcement Breaking the Glass Ceiling Award – will be promoted to Chief from her previous rank of Detective Lieutenant. Chief Zienowicz grew up in Chester and attended Villa Walsh Academy.  She earned a bachelor of arts degree in psychology from Boston College in 1999, and a master of arts degree in forensic psychology from John Jay College in New York City in 2003. She began her career with the Morris County Sheriff’s Office in 1999 as a civilian clerk-typist assigned to the Internal Affairs Section.  Within a year, she was hired as a Sheriff’s Investigator and in 2001, she attended and completed training at the Morris County Police Academy. Chief Zienowicz was first assigned to the Protective Services Division, which provides security and judicial protection at the courthouse complex. In August 2001, she was assigned to the Criminal Investigation Section – now called Crime Scene Investigation (CSI) – and spent 11 years in the Unit, assisting in multiple criminal investigations throughout Morris County. She was called as a witness for the prosecution in several high-profile criminal cases in Superior Court between 2003 and 2014. She was qualified as an expert fingerprint witness in the sexual assault trial and retrial of Andrew Pena, and testified about evidence in the murder trials of Jose Feliciano, convicted of murdering the Rev. Edward Hinds in Chatham in 2009; Anthony Novellino, convicted of killing his former wife, Judith, in Denville; and Carlos Rojas, found guilty of bludgeoning Esteban Hernandez Vazquez and leaving his body in the trunk of a car abandoned in Lincoln Park. Chief Zienowicz was promoted to the rank of Sergeant in April 2012 and assigned to the Legal Services Division as the Executions and Foreclosure Section Supervisor. That promotion was followed on March 1, 2016, by another advancement to the rank of Detective Lieutenant. She was assigned the post of Division Commander in the Administrative Division, overseeing Internal Affairs and the Special Operations Section. She then was transferred to the Protective Services Division in September 2016, where she oversaw the courthouse complex and operations and security at the Dover Probation Office. One of her most profound pleasures was her nomination to attend the 273rd Session of the prestigious FBI National Academy, a 10-week course of study in Quantico, Virginia, in the summer of 2018. Sheriff Gannon, who backed the nomination, is an FBI National Academy Graduate, as well. The FBI National Academy is a professional course of study for U.S. and international law enforcement managers who are nominated by their agency heads because of their demonstrated leadership abilities. The program provides coursework on intelligence theory, terrorism, terrorist mindsets, management science, law, behavioral science, communication and forensic science to improve the administration of justice in police departments and agencies. Upon returning from the FBI National Academy, Chief Zienowicz in September 2018 was transferred to the Special Services Division, overseeing CSI, Evidence Section, and the Bomb Unit. Assisting in the implementation of new technologies at the Sheriff’s Office, Chief Zienowicz was a member of the Evidence Unit start-up team for the BEAST evidence tracking system, guided implementation of the CivilServe civil process database system in the Executions and Foreclosure Unit, and coordinated use of the new Computer Aided Dispatch System within the Protective Services Division. Chief Zienowicz has logged a voluminous number of hours on training, including intensive courses on crash reconstruction, supervision of police personnel, shooting analysis and reconstruction, and interpretation of bloodstain patterns. She has received the Sheriff’s Achievement Award, Exceptional Duty Award, Unit Citation Medal, Professional Service Medal, Educational Achievement Medal-Masters Degree, Morris County Detective’s Association Distinguished Achievement Unit Award, and the NJ Women in Law Enforcement Breaking the Glass Ceiling Award, which is awarded to women who achieve a law enforcement rank of lieutenant or higher. Chief Zienowicz is a three-time Police Unity Tour rider and participates annually in the Special Olympics Torch Run.Chief Kelley Zienowicz Becomes Highest Ranking Woman in Morris County Sheriff’s Office added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "by Elsie Walker Halloween will soon be here.  Many times on Halloween, or around camp fires, stories of ghosts; strange, creepy or haunted places; and recollections of strange occurrences are shared.  Some people pass stories on from generation to generation until they become legend. However, others, like members of the New Jersey Ghost Hunters Society (NJGHS), investigate strange occurrences to see if there is a paranormal presence involved.  Recently, people from around the coverage area shared stories and sightings of local ghosts, rumors of haunted locations, and experiences with the paranormal. Members of the online, “You Know You’re From Roxbury Township….” group recalled ghost tales and scary sights.  One popular ghost story was the Hooker Man. It is about a ghost seen by the Succasunna railroad tracks. “The Hooker Man lost his hand in some freak train accident, and now searches for it with a lantern,” shared Mike Stark, Roxbury.   However, it appears the Hooker Man has not only been seen in Roxbury, but Netcong, Flanders, Chester, and Long Valley also lay claim to the legend. Cheryl McClung, a former area resident, who now lives in Georgia, shared, “At night, people see his [the Hooker Man’s] lantern bouncing along the tracks in Flanders on the west side of [Route} 206. Dawn Traetta Hair, of Florida, another former Roxbury resident, remembers the stories of the former location of the Church of the Mystic Light in Flanders.  The building is closed, but there had been claims that witches had hung chickens and have had seances there. People still stop by it, out of curiosity, if not scared away.Kim Howell Candore shared that there have been ghost sightings at her childhood home, “I was raised at 11 Meeker Street [in] Succasunna, next to the cemetery. There has been many spottings of two men in Civil War uniforms smoking, sitting on a tree stump in front of our old house,”   said Candore, who now lives in Tennessee. Candore remembers that the two churches on Main Street, adjacent to the cemetery, used to be a military hospital. Also shared, was that Roxbury has its very own “haunted house” in the form of the Halloween House, a tremendous display put on by the Heard family in Roxbury.Hackettstown is the meeting site of the NJ Ghost Hunters Society.  The society’s mission statement is “To search out definitive proof of life beyond the grave.  To provide paranormal investigations to those who request them, free of charge. To train those individuals, who so desire and become members of the NJGHS, in the protocols of professional, ethical and scientific paranormal investigating..” L’aura  Hladik Hoffman is the society’s founder and director. She is the author of Ghosthunting New Jersey, Ghosthunting New York City, and Ghosts of the Poconos and has a variety of presentations on the paranormal which will be given at area libraries this month  (listed on the bottom of www.njghs.net/presentations.html). Recently, Hoffman recalled stories she was told of two ghosts who are said to haunt Bea McNally’s (formerly Charlie Brown Restaurant).  In 1878, the place was the Clarendon House (hotel) and from 1926-1947 it was the Hackettstown Inn.  “The ghost girl appeared to a young girl who was living at the hotel when her family owned it. She snuck down to the kitchen in the middle of the night for some ice cream. When she was headed out of the kitchen and into the dining room to sneak back upstairs, she was met with this bright, sparkling light and out of the light stepped a young girl – about the same age of the girl sneaking the ice cream – and the ghost girl was dressed from a different time period and clutching her teddy bear. The ice cream girl screamed, dropped the ice cream and ran up to her room. The next day when her parents confronted her about the mess in the dining room, they did not believe her about the ghost girl she saw. However, a couple weeks later, the father saw the ghost girl, too.”As for the other ghost, Hoffman said there are various origin stories as to who he is. Most have to do with drowning. Two versions have him as a child who was staying upstairs and died while unattended in the bathtub.  Hoffman shared that in another version of the story, “A Lady of the Evening was distraught over unrequited love of one of her clients and she took a bath and drank a bottle of gin and passed out and drowned.” However, most seem to think the ghost is a child as they have got the sensation of someone wanting to ride on their shoulders or putting a small hand into theirs.Over the years there have been other stories of ghostly presence at the location, such as unexplained footsteps and, when there was a pool hall at the location, how when it was unlocked for business one day,  instead of the cleaned pool hall, cues, etc. were strung all over. In Pompton Lakes, Laura Jennings, a member of the historic commission there, shared about some caring spirits at the Schuyler Colfax house ( Hamburg turnpike, Wayne)  “Dr. Jane Colfax Young grew up in the house with her father (Dr. Richard S. Colfax) and Aunt (also Dr. Jane Colfax). Katherine Young, daughter to Jane Colfax Young, shared that she spent a lot of time in the home until he was ten years old. Both her and her father felt and saw things in the house that they are sure were the spirits of their ancestors watching over them. The Colfax family is one of the founding families in the area.”Jennings also shared that she had heard reports of ghost sightings at the Lenox School in Pompton Plains.Morristown has had its own dealing with the paranormal.  Pat Goodfriend, Membership & Volunteer Coordinator for the Morris County Historical Society shared a short 2016 article by Y. McGreevy on Ford Mansion. The mansion at the Morristown National Historical Park is over 200 years old.  Once the home of George Washington (briefly during 1780), the mansion drew the interest of Gordon Thomas Ward, a paranormal investigator, who in 2016, did a presentation on the Mansion and his two-year study of it, including the noises said to be coming from inside its walls.  An article by B. LaMuraglia the same year shows that during the time of his investigation, Ward heard the voices of three male and two female spirits.  None were Washington; Ward felt at least one could have been a kitchen servant. Bells Mansion, near the Netcong-Stanhope border has also been the subject of a paranormal study.  That was shared by Tom Lupo of Hopatcong, a producer who followed the NJ Ghost Hunters Society when it investigated the restaurant six years ago.  The segment includes a worker recalling seeing the spirit of a woman. He was cleaning up after the restaurant had closed. There are windows between the rooms.  He looked up and saw a woman, seated in the next room, looking out at the road. He watched her for about 10 seconds and then went to approach her. When he walked into that room, she was gone. This Halloween, will the Hooker Man or the little girl ghost at Bea McNally’s be seen?  Will voices whisper through Ford Mansion or the Lenox School? Perhaps, this year, a new spirit will be seen and its legend begun. Hauntings Around the Area for Halloween added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "St. Virgil Group Helps Keep Morris Plains Cleaner And Litter FreeAs the weather gets warmer, groups will be spreading out across Morris Plains to pick up litter and recyclables that have been carelessly tossed along roadways and in parks. The first to participate this year were a group of twelve students from St. Virgil.\n",
      "The St. Virgil group uses their mini grant money to help fund their yearly trip to Appalachia to help do work in this very depressed area. Along with two adults the young people were out on a chilly and drizzly first weekend in April to scour Simones Park. They picked up seven large bags of trash and two large bags of recyclables.\n",
      "Simones Park, at the end of Mountain Way, has been adopted by the sixth grade students from Borough School that have pledged to go out and clean the park four times a year. But Simones Park is a problem area. Even with the Borough School group, extra clean-ups, like this one by St. Virgil, and the help of neighbors that live across the street, litter is a consistent problem. Banners in the park with the litter program logo “Pick Up Morris Plains – Keep Us Litter Free” as a reminder to visitors have helped, but not enough.\n",
      "Litter is unhealthy, unsightly, and can be a safety hazard. Simones Park not only has soccer fields and open areas, but also has a well-used playground, so that broken bottles and crushed cans could lead to injuries.\n",
      "Anyone can help stop litter by using the many recycling containers and trash cans placed throughout the parks, as well as all along the main street, Speedwell Avenue. There is also a recycling container placed across the street from the train station. But even more important, the attitude that causes people to litter must be changed. People tend to think that somebody else will clean up litter left in the street or on the sidewalk, especially in places where there already is a lot of litter or places where the sense of community pride is low.\n",
      "Morris Plains wants everyone to take responsibility for their actions and pride in the environment and the town – don’t litter, put trash and recyclables in their proper place!\n",
      "Morris Plains Councilman John “Jack” Doherty is the liaison to the Clean Communities and Recycling programs and he commended the mini grant groups saying, “We are pleased that so many groups come out during the year to help with litter pickups, but hope our residents will keep our town a “community of caring” and do their part.”\n",
      "The groups that participate receive grant funds from the State Clean Communities Program. Penny Manser is head of the Youth Ministry at St. Virgil and said that, “The mission trip we take each summer is ten days of working with the people of Harlan, Kentucky, the 18th poorest county in the United States. The families there are picked by lottery for help with roofing, plumbing, painting, ditch digging, sheet rock work, siding, clean up from floods or whatever is needed by these local families. It is our opportunity to truly work as disciples in the world, and to learn to be grateful for the gifts that we have.”\n",

      "Morris Arts recently opened a 15th exhibit, entitled Black, White and Green at the Gallery in Morristown.  Guest curator Katherine Murdock, the Exhibition Committee of Morris Arts and the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation selected works by several outstanding artists in New Jersey and New York.\n",
      "Inspired by the biowall, the vertical garden of living plants within the exhibit space, Murdock chose to focus the exhibit on plants and selected the title, Black, White and Green, to purposefully reflect that limited color palette as a means of unifying the exhibit. What is striking, however, is the richness and variety of the artists’ unique approaches to the theme – through their use of different media (collage, oil, cold wax painting, photography, charcoal drawings, wood sculpture, etc.), composition, and subtle gradations of color.As Murdock notes, “Casey Ruble’s paper collage illustrates a bundled bouquet of invasive plant species and Kathy Cantwell’s oil and cold wax on panel explores green color fields that resemble landscape. Richard Bottwin uses plant material as a medium and highlights the wood grain with stain and paint.”The public is invited to view this exciting exhibit, open Mon.-Fri. from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and by appointment, and will remain on display until Aug. 24.  Visit www.morrisarts.org<https://www.morrisarts.org or call 973- 285-5115 for additional information.Morris Arts located in Morristown is a not-for-profit organization founded in 1973 dedicated to building community through the artsBlack, White, Green Art Exhibit Featured In Gallery added by new_view_media on March 19, 2016View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Locals Volunteer To Build A Better Life In GuatemalaBy Cheryl ConwayBeyond the conditions many can relate to, outside the walls of what’s the norm, exists a world so difficult to imagine unless one visits and reaches out to help.In Guatemala City, 11,000 people- in which 7,000 are kids- live and work inside a garbage dump.“Most survive by picking through the trash to earn less than five dollars a day. Many find their daily food in the dump.”Just when all hopelessness is lost for these human beings living in one of the most impoverished areas , more and more volunteers are stepping up to assist and steer them to a better life. Some local people have become very involved and formed an organization known as Beyond The Walls. This month, 75 individuals are volunteering to visit the Guatemala City Garbage Dump to build houses, donate clothing and shoes and organize sport clinics.The non-profit organization started in 2007 at the Mendham Hills Community Church, although mission teams were sent out before.“We had been going to Guatemala for a couple of years,” explains Betsy Ahl of Morris Township, executive director of Beyond The Walls. “The church was sending mission teams. We asked volunteers to help raise money to help pay for trips, build houses. They’d raise more money and that would go toward projects.”In order to influence others outside the church to get involved, and to receive matching grants from volunteers’ employers, organizers decided to expand the church group to a secular, non-profit organization, explains Ahl.The idea to help the people of Guatemala dates back to 2005, when Mendham was named one of the top wealthiest places to live in America.“The elders of Mendham Hills Chapel thought this wasn’t how others lived,” explains Ahl, “so they asked the chairman of the missions’ team to find an area that needed help.”One of the poorest places in the world, the Guatemala City Garbage Dump, was identified by a church member and the idea to team up with the Potter’s House organization, with a mission to eradicate poverty, build houses, help others get business loans and establish community programs.“It’s a ravine right in the center of the Capitol City,” describes Ahl. “They’ve been filling it up with garbage for 50 years.”In their first mission, Ahl joined 26 others for four days. The group, after that, “could have gone to Africa one year, China one year,” but the group decided it was more important to “come back and form long term relationships,” says Ahl who has sponsored three kids in Guatemala in the Kids In Potter House Education Program, in which 50 kids are sponsored to receive an education. Ahl has been sponsoring these kids since they were in the first grade, are now graduating high school and will be supported through college.Church member and organization volunteer, Mike Rubright, 50, of Long Valley, is currently on one of three missions to Guatemala this month through Beyond The Walls. His ninth trip out there during the past seven years, Rubright and his daughter, Erin, are working in the garbage dump from July 18-25.Another one of his daughters, Emily, has gone on the trip seven times but had to miss this one. Youth volunteers must be starting atleast seventh grade to participate, so for Erin this is her third trip. Volunteers must contribute $1,600 each in order to participate, with funds going toward flight and lodging; and additional funds to supplies and building houses. Every year, Rubright sends letters and emails to friends requesting donations to help support his volunteer work.About 75 people have signed up through Beyond The Walls to volunteer during the three missions this month, with 10 people from the Mendham, Long Valley and Chester areas. The others are from areas throughout the country such as Florida, New York and Texas, who formed their own groups with Beyond The Walls.Rubright and his wife, Katie, have a niece who was adopted from Guatemala so their connection is even greater.“I do construction all day long,” says Rubright. “I had no idea what I was doing; I had no construction experience. Now I’m the person in charge of construction projects my week.“Everybody builds, everybody works; it doesn’t matter how old you are,” says Rubright, principal at the Woodglen Middle School in Lebanon Twp.“We build a concrete block house with a concrete floor,” he explains. “We mix concrete by hand; it’s the hardest thing I’ve ever done. The girls and women work harder than I’ve ever seen; they don’t stop.” A family that is getting a house built works beside the volunteers.“It’s not very big,” he says, with the homes about 15 feet by 15 feet,” the size of a bedroom. Homes are for four to five person families, and sometimes six to eight people.It’s like “nine people living in the size of your kitchen,” describes Ahl. Homes are built side by side and cost $5,600 to build.A completed house consists of one big room with one eight-foot partition wall that separates the bedrooms from “everything else,” says Rubright. “They have a toilet and a shower stall” in an area about the size of a closet, and they get “a big concrete sink” that can weigh up to 600 pounds, which is used for all washing needs such as dishes and clothes.Rubright also works under Guatemala masons who are very particular with how they want things to be completed, he says.“They tell us what to do,” says Rubright. “There are a lot of times we do things that don’t make sense; you can’t tell them they are wrong. That’s frustrating. If they tell you to put a hole in a concrete pipe with a hammer and nails, instead of a drill, you do it.”The homes that are being built for the people in the Guatemala City Garbage Dump is luxury compared to the “cardboard sheet metal,” dirt, chemicals, methane gas that surround them and sicken them while living in the dump and “breathing the trash.”These houses also provide shelter and protection for these people, says Rubright, as gun shots are commonly fired in the garbage dump.His goal during this one week visit is to build three to five houses with his group of volunteers.Potter’s House has built 110 homes to date, with 75 contributed by the volunteers of Beyond The Walls, says Ahl, who visits four times, about six weeks a year.In addition to building homes, the volunteers lead soccer clinics and donate uniforms, soccer balls and cleats as well as baseball clinics and donations of t-shirts; help at a medical clinic, vacation Bible school, and deliver groceries and visit families.Through their efforts, much progress has been made such as concrete roads, a community center built last year, education programs which is much needed as the average kid does not go past fifth grade in Guatemala, says Rubright.“A lot of families look at education as not important,” says Rubright. “A lot end up working in the garbage dump” as scavengers. “They make money picking out recyclables. People sift through trash looking through recyclables to see what they can sell” or “they are looking for food to eat it.” Parents stop sending their kids to school because they need their school age kids to watch younger siblings so parents can work.If they are not scavengers, they rely on the garbage dump to sell their own goods, like tortillas to the scavengers so they can eat, and even jewelry, says Ahl.“It’s just this culture of poverty,” says Ahl, with high unemployment. “Education is not a value, that’s the bottom line. Potter’s House tries to teach the value of education especially to the parents.” It also tries to teach the vendors who do sell inside the garbage dump to sell on the outside, says Ahl.“But without education, it’s really, really hard to move their way out of the dump,” says Ahl.Scavengers are even making less these days. As the economy declined, so did the value of recyclables, explains Rubright. For those working 10 to 12 hour days, they are making two to three dollars.While “there are guns everywhere, “Rubright admits that he feels safe when there.“The organization we are with is well respected,” he says, and they stay in a retreat center with accommodations like that of a motel or college dorm. “We are safe; every store has an armed guard,” and no one walks alone. “We have relationships with people. We go to the same neighborhoods. There’s more of a comfort level now. It’s a safe place- I bring my kids there I’m not in fear of our lives.”It is the desire to help others and the appreciation that brings Rubright back to the dump.He says, “If there’s really a God, why does he let that happen? We let it happen by not choosing to use our resources that way. I don’t think I could not go back. They have so little but they appreciate everything they have. We have so much and we want so much more.”They say, “This morning I lived in a garbage dump; now I live in a mansion.”Rubright admits, “I’ve learned more from them than they get from me. I’m a better person in Guatemala than I am here.”Also nice is the community bond shared by the volunteers.For the last five or six years, the same group of people have been volunteering. “Everyone enjoys each other’s company,” say Rubright. “We work hard all day, you come back eat dinner. There’s community; there’s no television, little internet, no cell services. It’s a lot what life should be like.”Like Ahl, the Rubrights have sponsored a girl there since she was eight; now she is 17. Through their support they have helped Jennifer Lopez Munoz continue to go to school and get an education.Rubright tells people, “I have three daughters in America and one in Guatemala.”“All the kids down there, they know when we come back,” says Rubright. “It’s humbling; it’s like family.” Volunteers bring with them bags of clothing and shoes for more than 200 kids.Beyond the Walls has helped other communities outside of Guatemala, such as Native Americans, homeless people in Dover and in Newark.Rubright plans to volunteer at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota next, which is known as the poorest place in the U.S., next to Haiti, from alcoholism and unemployment faced by Native Americans. “This was their country and they are at the bottom of the ladder.”Beyond the Walls is always seeking more volunteers, contributions for clothing and shoes, and financial support.Its next mission to the garbage dump is Oct. 24-31, with already 20 people signed up.Go to Beyondthewalls.org for more information. To volunteer, email gobeyomdthewalls@gmail.com.“I encourage people to go, go somewhere,” says Rubright, Long Valley softball coach for the past 14 years and former school board member. “Find something to do where you can do something for someone else. There are people everywhere who need something. You do not need to be religious. Some people think it’s a church thing – it’s people helping other people.”Locals Volunteer To Build A Better Life In Guatemala added by new_view_media on August 18, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "On Sun., Sept. 13 Macculloch Hall Historical Museum welcomes Linda J. Barth from the Canal Society of New Jersey (CSNJ) Barth will present a program about The Delaware and Raritan Canal (D&R). The D&R is one of the subjects of the current second floor gallery exhibit “Canals of New Jersey” which will be available to view prior to the presentation.Canal author and historian Linda J. Barth will introduce the people, the bridges, the locks, and the aqueducts that made D&R Canal work. This waterway, now a “greenway” and the centerpiece of a popular state park, transported men and supplies between New York and Philadelphia during three wars. Inventor John Holland used the canal to deliver his Holland VI submarine to Washington for its Navy trials, and luxury yachts, like J .P. Morgan’s Tarantula, cruised the waterway.For more than 170 years, the D&R Canal has meandered across the narrow waist of New Jersey and was one of the nation’s most successful towpath canals, carrying more tonnage in 1866 than the more famous Erie Canal. Johnson & Johnson, Roebling, and Fleischmann’s Distillery all had their start along the D&R. These days the canal provides the people of central New Jersey with both a water supply and a premier recreational facility. Today, the Morris Canal Greenway, a partnership between local communities and the Canal Society of New Jersey, seeks to preserve the surviving historic remains of the canal, interpret canal sites, and offer recreational opportunities to the public. In this presentation Linda will discuss the history and operation of the canal and how it is used today.MHHM opens at 1 p.m. on Sept. 13 and visitors who arrive prior to the 4:30 p.m. program can enjoy the “Canals of New Jersey” exhibit. MHHM has partnered with CSNJ to present this display of panels that tell the story of New Jersey’s two towpath canals, the Morris and the Delaware and Raritan. The CSNJ’s display is supplemented by objects including some from MHHM’s collection and information about Macculloch Hall founder George Macculloch who had the idea for the Morris Canal. The exhibit shares some of the stories of the workers and families who lived and worked on the canal, as well as other details about its construction using photographs and drawings, as well objects such as model canal boats.Tickets for the program go on sale from 1 p.m., no advance sales, and remain on sale until the presentation begins at 4:30 p.m. Speaker tickets include admission to the museum exhibits during the afternoon and a guided tour of period rooms, the last tour ticket is sold at 3 p.m. Speaker tickets will remain on sale until 4:30 p.m.The Museum’s second floor “The Civil War Through the Eyes of Thomas Nast” and “Canals of New Jersey” exhibits will remain on view until 4:30 p.m. The first floor “Thomas Nast: Unknown Works and American Icons” exhibit will close 3:30 p.m. – 4 p.m. in preparation for the program. Tickets to hear speakers are Adults $8; Seniors & Students $6; Children 6 – 12 $4. Members and children under 5 are admitted free.For more information call Karen Hollywood, Publicity and Programs Coordinator Macculloch Hall Historical Museum at (973) 538-2404 ext. 15.Linda Barth To Speak At MHHM added by new_view_media on August 16, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "An Evening with The Monkees\n",
      "Featuring Micky Dolenz and Peter TorkThursday, August 27 at 8 pm(Morristown) – Hey, hey it’s The Monkees, featuring Micky Dolenz and Peter Tork, coming to Mayo Performing Arts Center on Thursday, August 27, 2015 at 8 pm. Tickets are $49-99.When four young men were cast in the television roles of a struggling rock band inspired by The Beatles’ A Hard Day’s Night, few could have predicted the impact The Monkees would make on music and pop culture at large, an impact that still reverberates 50 years later.Assembled in Los Angeles in 1965 by Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider for the television series The Monkees, the quartet of Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith, Peter Tork, and the late Davy Jones brought a singular mix of pop, rock, psychedelica, Broadway, and country to their music. The show itself, meanwhile, paid tribute not only to The Beatles, but also to the comedy stylings of The Marx Brothers and Laurel and Hardy as well as the pop-art sensibilities of Warhol and the emerging San Francisco psychedelic scene.The Monkees’ first single, “Last Train to Clarksville,” was released in August 1966, hitting #1 and serving as advance publicity for their series, which debuted on September 12. When the group’s self-titled debut album arrived in stores a month later, it quickly headed for the top spot of the Billboard charts, where it would ultimately sit for 13 of the 78 weeks it remained in the Top 200. (Two decades later, in the midst of a new burst of Monkee-mania, The Monkees popped back onto the charts, bringing the total number of weeks to 102.)By the time the group’s TV series aired its final new episode on March 25, 1968, the Monkees had seen three further albums top the charts – More of the Monkees, Headquarters, and Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones, Ltd., all of which were released in 1967, staggeringly enough – while racking up several more hit singles, with “I’m a Believer,” “(I’m Not Your) Steppin’ Stone,” “A Little Bit Me, A Little Bit You,” “The Girl I Knew Somewhere,” “Pleasant Valley Sunday,” “Words,”  “Daydream Believer,” “Valleri,” and “Tapioca Tundra” all finding their way into the Billboard Top 40.After the series’ two-season run, the group went on to star in the cult feature film HEAD (co-written by Jack Nicholson) and a TV special (33 1/3 Revolutions per Monkee) while also continuing to record new material, but much as the ’60s gave way to the ’70s, the members of the Monkees eventually gave in to their individual musical interests and went their separate ways. for awhile.In February 1986, after MTV broadcast a marathon of The Monkees, Dolenz, Jones, and Tork reunited for a 20th anniversary tour, with Nesmith joining them onstage for the Los Angeles date of the tour, and in 1996, all four members of the group reunited for a new album (Justus) and TV special (Hey, Hey, It’s the Monkees).In the wake of Jones’s death on February 29, 2012, the surviving members of the Monkees reunited and performed a series of concerts. The shows were greeted with sell-out response and phenomenal reviews. Now, Micky Dolenz and Peter Tork carry on that tradition with a full evening of magic music and multi-media splendor, including clips from their Emmy Award winning series. Their new show features all of the Monkees hits, plus an intimate acoustic set and solo spots for each of the singers. An Evening With The Monkees is sure to please every fan of the band.Mayo Performing Arts Center, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, presents a wide range of programs that entertain, enrich, and educate the diverse population of the region and enhance the economic vitality of Northern New Jersey. The 2015-2016 season is made possible, in part, by a grant the New Jersey State Council on the Arts/Department of State, a Partner Agency of the National Endowment for the Arts, as well as support received from the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation, F.M. Kirby Foundation and numerous corporations, foundations and individuals.

      "By Steve SearsSeptember 11, 2001 started out like a gorgeous late summer day. The beautiful day soon turned ugly, as the biggest attack against the United States of America on home soil claimed 2,977 lives combined in New York City at the World Trade Center, the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., and in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.New View Media Group reached out to various community members, seeking their remembrance of that fateful day.Alex RomanTownship of Mount Olive Councilman Alex Roman lost his Mom, 49-year-old Arcelia Castillo, on September 11, 2001. Instead of her normal 9:00 a.m., she had arrived early to work that morning at 7:45 a.m. to the World Trade Center North Tower.American Airlines Flight 11 hit the tower at 8:48 a.m.“I prefer to be left alone on 9/11,” says Roman. “Much like my mother, I’m not comfortable with being viewed as a victim. My kids also spend the day quietly reflecting.  We have attended several 9/11 ceremonies in New York City in the past, but mostly we prefer to go to the 9/11 Memorial at different times of the year.”Roman celebrates his Mom’s life just like anyone else that has lost a loved one. “I never assume my loss is greater than anyone else’s,” he says. “I keep a picture of her at my shop along with a framed United States flag that was presented to us by President (George W) Bush. I routinely talk about her to my wife and kids and how each of them have some of her qualities. Her name regularly comes up at family gatherings.”“As 9/11 approaches, I feel guilty being happy (my birthday is Sept. 8). It’s like a rollercoaster ride.”Ray PerkinsFormer Township of Mount Olive Town Council President Ray Perkins was on the West Side Highway of Manhattan on the morning of September 11, 2001.“I was in the city that day that the attack happened, and I was on my way into midtown, and a plane probably hit a few minutes after I passed by there. I’m on my way to attend a meeting up near Grand Central, and I get a call from one of my colleagues, and he says, ‘Hey, a plane just hit the (World) Trade Center – and it was a commercial plane!’ I said, “You’re kidding me!’ I get up to my appointment – and I’m passing ambulances and fire trucks like crazy, they’re sailing down towards this place – and I get to where I’ve got to go, and everybody is sitting there looking at the television. Out the window you could see the buildings. I then said, ‘I can’t believe this – oh my God!”Perkins headed to a pay phone (cell phone connections were knocked out that morning) line of about 200 people to wait and make a call, and then the second plane, United Airlines Flight 175, crashed into the South Tower. Perkins then exited the line and started running towards downtown, reached 23rd Street, then headed into a store to buy 12-packs of water, giving it to those who’d just experienced the most terrifying moments of their lives. “These people walking towards me look like someone had dumped flour on them, because now the buildings had collapsed.”Perkins knew that Mount Olive needed to remember the lives that were lost that day, and he kicked a memorial idea in motion. “On (United Airlines) Flight 93 that went down (in Shanksville, Pennsylvania), was Hilda Marcin, a woman from town, was employed through the Board of Education as a teacher. I had met Hilda; what a pleasant lady. She was moving out to live with her other daughter in California.” Mayor Rob Greenbaum got involved, donations gathered, and current Council President Joe Nicastro’s stepson, Michael Lalama, came up with the design rendition. Perkins then forwarded the design to a Canadian company called Picture This in Granite, who took care of the final product. “We got an amazing amount of support,” says Perkins. “It was tremendous. It was heartwarming to see the community members and the township employees that dedicated their time and expertise to getting this done.”Bruno Varano“Before it all happened, the day was incredibly beautiful.”Bruno Varano officially became a United States citizen in 1961. The morning of 9/11, the Assistant Special Agent in Charge was at his office in Fairfield, New Jersey.Varano, currently President of the Local 121 of the Federal Agent PBA, got a call that morning from one of his New York agents. “He said, ‘Listen, we got attacked.’ I said, ‘What are you talking about?’ I told him to cut it out and he said, ‘No, I’m telling you – we got attacked.”“I then got a call from D.C. and realized it did happen.” “It was right after the second tower fell that I got in there (to the city),” he remembers. “I’m not sure if you’ve ever seen that Arnold Schwarzenegger movie, The Terminator, and one scene showed that in the future there was a huge war, and there are atomic bombs, it was like hell – everything was gray, everything was cloudy, there was smoke and everything was destroyed. That’s what it looked like. It was incredible.”Varano checked into his office several blocks north of the area, and he and his team tried to see what they could do. “It was just a mess; so chaotic.  Nobody knew what the hell was going on. Sirens – ambulances and fire trucks – were still going back and forth, and then at one point you couldn’t go anywhere. The soot, the dust, and the metal…you couldn’t move in cars, you had to go on foot. There were still fires going on there, the State police were there, they were bringing in the military. It took a day or so to get acclimated to what was going on.”“But that first day – I don’t know how to explain it,” he states. “I guess try to walk into a volcano without getting cut, without getting burned, without getting killed. There was no ground to walk on. It was nothing but debris.”Joel KatzJoel Katz, an investment banking firm employee of Sandler O’Neill and Partners, was on the 104th floor of the South Tower that fateful morning.“I was on the trading floor, we had all the window shades down on the windows because of the glare, so we can’t really see outside, and we hear a big roar – and we had heard roars before that high up – but this really shook the whole floor,” he recalls. “It kind of stopped the floor for a moment, but we went back to what we were doing.”A man from the other side of the floor came running over to inform Katz and others that a commercial plane had just struck tower one. Katz started thinking. “It was a beautiful, crisp day. It didn’t add up that a pilot would do that. We had plenty of cloudy days when you wondered if that was going to happen, where we’re in the fog, but this was a beautiful day.”The smell of jet fuel was very strong, and Katz felt that the situation was uncomfortable. He and 16 other people left the floor to start their descent and exit the building. Once he exited the building and was about fifty yards, he heard another big roar. It was another commercial jet, this time striking the very building he had minutes before departed.“17 people who were at work at my company escaped, and 66 people died,” he says.As Katz walked up the street, he thought about his coworkers. “I told them I was going downstairs, and they said, ‘Okay, see ya,’ and never gave it second thought. They had little babies at home, they had wives and families like I did – I had young children at the time – and they were in peril, so I thought of them. I thought of my family, obviously.” Eventually Katz made it to a friend’s home in Ridgewood, New Jersey, where he met his family. “This became a congregation area for us, and we were getting calls from the wives of coworkers asking if we had seen their husbands. They (the calls) were very hard and I didn’t know.” A few days later, Katz and his team were stationed temporarily at a new location, and all the surviving employees hugged. “We helped each other, spent the next two months going to funerals – sometimes three to four a day – and the company provided counseling services if we needed it.”Katz, who now teaches Finance as an adjunct professor at County College of Morris, occasionally gives talks regarding 9/11. “The people who died were innocent people going to work like I, who had young families, who went to work and didn’t come home. I think  that’s obviously a tragedy, and I think in honor of them and the lives they led, the love they had and it was an injustice to them, their families and their country — I think it’s important to remember the lives they led, the spirit that they shared, and I don’t ever want to forget that I knew these people.”“In my mind, they died as heroes.”Tom MillerTom Miller has been practicing fine art for years. He has a master’s in fine arts from the University of Idaho. He works in watercolor, colored pencil, ceramics, and more, and his topics are a variety. A Marine veteran, he was working at the time at Madison’s Fairleigh Dickinson University on an Operation Harvest Moon project, which is the operation he got injured in during his time in the Marines. “Along comes the morning of 9/11, I’m at home waiting to go to a screenwriting course – it was a 9:30 class – I’m drinking a cup of coffee, and had the radio on, and heard of a plane crash (at the World Trade Center). So, I turn  the television on to see what was up, and then I saw a second plane go in.”Miller went to his class but first stopped at Columbia Turnpike and Park Avenue in Florham Park to view the on-goings. “I could see it, just a bit of the towers and the smoke. “I tried to get into the city, asked the Morris County sheriffs to take me in, but they couldn’t.”Learning that the towers had fell during the class, Miller started going to work on his 9/11 artwork. He has roughly 65 pieces, and he still creates them. His creations are given to first responders.Miller, 78, lost a neighbor, Michael Sorresse, in the attacks. “He was a neighbor and a friend. I would say he was in his 30s, just had gotten married, worked for Marsh USA Agencies up on the 101st floor of tower one. I really liked him. He was a really nice kid. Then there was Giovanna Galletta “Gennie” Gambale (of Cantor Fitzgerald). I did a ceramic sculpture of her missing poster – I got her family’s okay.”He then deeply reflects. “It (9/11) was as important as when my partner died in my arms (during an Operation Harvest Moon battle in 1965),” says Miller. “So many people, such a senseless thing, and because Mike died, too.”Rita WeinerWhen 9/11 occurred, a big piece of Rita Weiner’s heart was ripped apart.That morning, she was preparing to head into New York City with her daughter, Michele. “My husband called me and told me something had hit the World Trade Center. Then, while watching television, I saw the second plane hit.”“We didn’t go in; no one went in. 9/11 was horrendous.” She pauses, then continues. “I was angry. I’m a New Yorker at heart and have always lived in the tri-state area. This is my heart, just like if you’re from France, Paris is yours. I grew up in the area — Rockefeller Center, skating over there, Times Square, the whole bit – and to see it demolished like this… it was very, very hard.”The next day, Weiner saw a Salvation Army ad asking for help at Ground Zero. Her Dad was alive at the time, and he saw the same ad. “He said, ‘When I was in World War II, the Salvation Army brought me blankets, they brought me hope, and I never forgot it.’ And he suggested I join.”She worked with the Salvation Army on Thursdays, noon – midnight. And when Weiner, who prepared meals as a volunteer, and her entourage first arrived at the sight, she was shocked. “It was an absolute disaster. It looked like a nuclear explosion. It was like nothing I’ve ever seen, and the smell…I’ll never forget it. It was like decay, decomp. It goes in your nostrils and you never forget it for the rest of your life. The ash would be up to your knee when you walked through it.” She then adds, “You would think from such large office buildings, you would find desks and other things…nothing, it was like a giant crematorium. Another thing: we were not allowed to cry in front of the people. If you had to cry, you had to go in the back.”However, it was a period Weiner would not regret. “It was cathartic and healing for me. It was healing for them and healing for me. Instead of feeling helpless and important, I was doing something. I was helping somebody hurting.”After serving at Ground Zero and the “other” Ground Zero (a morgue) with the Salvation Army from September 2001 to May 30, 2002, she then became a tour guide for World Trade Center Tribute Tours from October 2005 until 2018. She eventually received an award from the center for doing 500 tours, and even got her first tattoo ever…on her back, which has the 9/11 symbol and reads, “Remember and pray”. “It was in my DNA,” she says. The whole experience changed her. “There’s pre-9/11 Rita, and there’s post-9/11 Rita. Pre-9/11 was good; you never saw tragedy, you heard about Pearl Harbor, but you weren’t really a part of it. Post-9/11, I lived it personally; this was the first on my soil, in my town. I had hatred, and that bothered me, because I am a loving, giving person, and I don’t like having hatred in my heart. And I do believe when you have bitterness and hatred it kills you.” Serving with others fought the hatred. “I needed to express myself somehow to help others. The Salvation Army was the perfect way.’Her advice? “Enjoy every day you have, because you see how quickly it can be taken away.”Remembering 9/11 18 Years Later added by new_view_media on September 15, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Jessica Sidhu, 22, of Chester, New Jersey, has been accepted into the Peace Corps and departed for Fiji in August to begin training as a Community Youth Empowerment Volunteer. “I have always been passionate about doing my part to help others around me. I believe internationally and domestically there are so many positive benefits of youth development programming to help prevent negative outcomes when facing adverse life situations. I believe in the Peace Corps’ long-term relationship based grassroots approach to sharing resources with individuals elsewhere. I love meeting people of different cultures, am passionate about youth development, and enjoy traveling so this job is perfect for me!” said Sidhu of her desire to join the Peace Corps. Sidhu is the daughter of Nancy and Paul Sidhu of Chester and a graduate of West Morris Mendham High School in Mendham, New Jersey. She attended the University of Maryland College Park in College Park, Maryland, where she earned a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology in 2018. Prior to joining the Peace Corps, she worked as a Child Behavioral Specialist for the YMCA in Montgomery County, Maryland, and interned at Peace Corps Headquarters. During the first three months of her service, Sidhu will live with a host family in Fiji to become fully immersed in the country’s language and culture. After acquiring the necessary skills to assist her community, Sidhu will be sworn into service and assigned to a community in Fiji, where she will live and work for two years with the local people. “I hope to continue my path of working with children to help inspire them to find their skills and positive abilities. I am excited to create youth development programming to help aid the educational and personal development of the students I work with in Fiji,” Sidhu said. Sidhu will work in cooperation with the local people and partner organizations on sustainable, community-based development projects that improve the lives of people in Fiji and help Sidhu develop leadership, technical and cross-cultural skills that will give her a competitive edge when she returns home. Peace Corps volunteers return from service as global citizens well-positioned for professional opportunities in today’s global job market. Sidhu joins the 165 New Jersey residents currently serving in the Peace Corps and more than 5,400 New Jersey residents who have served in the Peace Corps since 1961. The Peace Corps currently has a high need for applicants to fill volunteer programs departing by June 2020. Interested Americans can apply online by October 1 for hundreds of available openings in nearly 30 countries worldwide. Volunteers receive a living stipend, extensive language and technical training, and financial benefits including student loan deferment and graduate school fellowships after service.

      "By Steve SearsLarissa Donohue, a sophomore at Morristown, New Jersey’s Villa Walsh Academy, is quite accomplished in the sport of Invictus Sport Taekwondo.Donohue, who perfects her skills under the tutelage of Richard DeGeorge at Shim’s Martial Arts Academy in Union, New Jersey, participates in “Olympic Taekwondo Sparring”. She has practiced the sport since age 5. “I was doing a lot of different sports when I was little just to try things,” she recalls, “and I really liked it, and I kind of started to stick with it around third grade. I was around age 9, and I kind of started to drop other sports that I was doing.”Donohue, a Randolph resident and 2nd degree Black Belt, has won many individual and team medals, and this 2019 season was named an All-American athlete by the United States of America Taekwondo (USAT, the national governing body for the sport and division of the USOC – United States Olympic Committee). So far this season, she has won gold medals in competitions in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Texas, won a silver against international competition in New Jersey and at the Pan America games in Portland, Oregon, and has won a bronze medal at the USAT national competition in Minneapolis. Donohue attributes her love of the sport to the fun and strategy of it. “I love training, and it’s really intense training, more than soccer and almost every other sport.” She elaborates “It’s speed, it’s strength, it’s thinking quick in the moment – you have to not only get away from another person’s kicks, but you have to kick back.”Nine members are on Donohue’s team, and the season runs all year round. Her toughest opponent faced is Canada’s Nadja Testic, a top-rated Taekwondo fighter, who bested Donohue in a close match. Donohue currently fights in the Junior (15-17 year-old) World Class Black Belt Division in the 55kg (121 lbs.) weight class.Jay and Kathleen Donohue support their daughter 100%. “It means a lot. I know it is a huge time commitment and they are able to financially support me, and also emotionally support me.”Jay Donohue speaks to his daughter’s dedication to the sport. “As her parents, we never realized the commitment involved in this sport at the competitive level.  When Larissa first started TKD at a young age, we were just hoping for her to learn basic balance, get some exercise and learn some discipline. We never realized we would ultimately be traveling across the country (and now internationally this coming year) to attend competitions and seminars.  Larissa’s schedule keeps everyone busy. When in full training, it’s a 5 to 6 day a week commitment for Larissa (and parents). Between strength and conditioning and sport-specific workouts, we’re always taking Larissa somewhere to train or compete. On top of this, she needs to strictly manage her diet, as this is a weight-division sport.  We don’t know how she does it, but Larissa is able to pack all this in and schoolwork too. Larissa’s ability to manage all the vigorous activity — let alone being able to walk onto a mat and fight someone — has always impressed us.”Donohue’s future includes (hopefully) the Paris Olympics in 2024, and she is also interested in a future career in nutrition in sports, because, “It’s such a big part of my life right now.” Villa Walsh Academy Sophomore Sparkling in the Sport of Taekwondo added by new_view_media on September 3, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "By Steve SearsThree students attending New Jersey schools were recently selected along with seventeen others around the country to take part in the BASF 2019 Science Academy at Fairleigh Dickinson University in Madison.Jefferson High School representative Patrick Flynn, Morristown High School’s Sheetal Bangalore, and Theo Coughlin, who hails from Tuxedo Park, New York but attends nearby Delbarton High School, were among others from across the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico attending the two-week long academy. 2019 is the ninth consecutive year BASF of Florham Park has hosted the Science Academy. Molly Borst is Manager, STEM Education – North America. “Our hope is to expand the program with other universities. It is a BASF program, and it’s a two-week comprehensive program that includes both Chemistry and Business. All of our students (who are broken down into five teams of four individuals each) – ultimately their projects – they’re going to be formulating a personal care product in the laboratory, and coming up with a go-to market strategy, bringing both of those things to a final graduation presentation at headquarters where there will be a panel of BASF executives and FDU professors that they’ll present to.”Flynn enjoys the hands-on experience with in-the-field professionals. “We have marketing and business professors, and then we have college chemistry professors telling us the real things we’ll actually have to know if we’re trying to enter the industry, so it’s just so important that we have this hands-on experience, and we’re able to make the connection. In high school, you have chemistry class and business class, but here you’re really making the connection. You can have fun in the lab, but it’s no use if you can’t market your product and sell it , so that’s a really important part that a lot of high school education misses is the connection between these different fields.” “First you get nominated by your school – the school is able to nominate two students – and then you fill out an application that consists of some essay questions,” says Bangalore, explaining the application process. “One of them, I think that was an important question, was ‘How do you see science and sustainability in the future?’. I was the only one who knew about the program because I volunteered at the Morris Museum two years for a Kids Lab  at “Chemistry Day,” and I met Molly and she told me about it. I became interested in applying once I was in 11th grade, and I was the only student who knew much about it in my school, hence I was the only one nominated, and the only student that applied for it.”Coughlin says focusing on both the creative (chemistry) and financial (marketing) aspects impresses him. “The combination between the marketing and the science is really the most unique part of the BASF Academy,” he attests. “If you can really notice both sides and aspects of the business, you can really contribute in the future in a positive way and bring something in development through the marketplace and make it successful and actually help people.”“What I really like is they’re from all over North America,” says James Salierno, Chair of the Departments of Biological and Allied Health Sciences at FDU, regarding the various areas and backgrounds of the students. “I’m always really impressed with how they conduct themselves in the lab, as high school students. I’m not really familiar with curriculum in high school, but they do really, really well in terms of following directions and using equipment. They get a great, well-rounded experience the whole time.”According to Borst, it’s most of all about keeping the love of science alive. “It’s a wide sampling of students, hoping that we’re just kind of inspiring that love of science and ultimately, helping us with the filling of that talent pipeline. We know,” says Borst, “that we’re in need of scientists. We’re really trying to keep that love going so they’ll continue down that path.”Three Morris County Students Attend the BASF 2019 Science Academy added by new_view_media on September 3, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "By: Danielle Incognito The NJ Sharing Network is a non-profit organization responsible for the recovery and placement of donated organs and tissues for the nearly 4,000 New Jersey residents waiting for a life-saving transplant. It is also a part of the national recovery system which currently serves 115,000 people on the national waiting list. Gary Imhoff, Marketing and Communications Manager of the NJ Sharing Network (New Providence, NJ) shared, “In 2018, 678 life-saving transplants were made possible, 537 from deceased donors and an additional 141 from living donors. Every day, approximately three people are added to the New Jersey waiting list, and one person dies every three days while waiting for a transplant. One organ donor can save eight lives, and one tissue donor can restore health to over 75 people.” Kelly Bonventre, a hospital service manager at Saint Clare’s Hospital (Dover and Denville), helps educate the staff on the process and activity regarding the network’s mission.  She networks and makes relationships based on the importance of work The Sharing Network does. She shared that she makes rounds in the emergency rooms and ICU to provide the information to the specific areas in the hospital that would most likely benefit from the information. She also ensures that the staff is medically trained in case by case need. One Flanders, New Jersey man’s life mission was to help others and save lives.  Even in his passing at St. Clare’s Hospital (Denville) on June 15, he fulfilled his mission as an organ donor for the NJ Sharing Network.  He was 52 years old. During his life, he accomplished great things and gave his life to helping others. He was a life-long member of the Flanders Fire Dept., serving as both past Chief & past President. Fred also served Mt. Olive Twp. as Fire Marshal, Construction Official, Captain of EMS, and OEM Coordinator. He was an avid Yankees fan, enjoyed smoking cigars, playing with his pup, and spending quality time with his three daughters Kelsey, Morgan, and Riley as documented in his obituary.  The family showed his same compassion as they asked for donations to the American Heart Association in lieu of flowers after his death. On its website, NJ Sharing Network encourages all communities to learn more about the life-saving benefits of organ and tissue donation. They post that increased awareness can be very helpful when talking with family members, friends and co-workers about the benefits of organ donation.   Mr. Imhoff  of the NJ Sharing Network shared that New Jersey residents can help save lives by registering as organ and tissue donors at www.NJSharingNetwork.org, having a conversation with family and friends, and joining NJ Sharing Network at its upcoming events. He also shared that in 2020, the Transplant Games of America are coming to NJ with 12,000 -15,000 people expected to attend this biennial multi-sport festival recognizing the success of donation and transplantation and honoring the generosity of donors and their families.  More info is available at www.njsharingnetwork.org/tgameadowlands2020.

      "By Steve SearsKevin Hennelly, entering his 24th season as Head Coach of the West Morris Central Wolfpack High School Football team in Chester, pays no attention to preseason rankings, nor does he look beyond the current opponent to be faced on the gridiron.“I’ll be honest. I don’t read the paper on it; I don’t follow social media or any of that. I don’t listen to any preseason stuff. I don’t pay attention to any of it.” WMC finished the 2018 season a disappointing 5 – 5, which included a 28 – 16 loss in the state playoffs to Irvington. The Wolfpack had the game sealed, but two blocked punts, a rarity during Hennelly’s regime, enabled the host team to win. “It was a difficult season,” Hennelly confirms. “I thought we were in good shape. We were beating Irvington by a couple of scores with a couple of minutes left, and I’ve never had a punt blocked as a head coach until last year, and they blocked two. So, we didn’t do a good job finishing the last two games. Overall it was a disappointing season last year. The kids played hard, the coaches – we worked like we do every year. But the games that we usually win – and we usually win when we’re ahead by two scores; we run out the clock, slow the game down – so, those two or three games that West Morris (Central) wins that we didn’t last year, that was a little disappointing.” The Wolfpack, who last won a state title in 2012 but lost in the semi-final rounds in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017, compete in the North Jersey Super – Freedom Blue conference. A bright spot for 2019 is the fact that the Wolfpack were not hurt significantly by graduation. Safety Joe Vasquez and Jake Ligos, who played both defensive end and tight end (the latter is headed to University of Pennsylvania), have exited, but a strong nucleus returns. “We have our skill guys back,” says Hennelly, “so we have experience with a couple of guys (Damian Engle, Ryan Schilling) at receiver, our fullback (Adam Smith) is back, a couple of running backs (Schilling, Jack DiPietro, Mark Ward), and both quarterbacks (Ryan Spano and Kevin Finlay). We’ve just got to develop a line.” On the defensive side, Ward returns at defensive back, and all of the beforementioned also play on the defensive side of the ball. Possible starting lineman will be Mike Battaglino, Garrett Domaratzky, Filece Montella, Jorge Montenegro, Kevin Ramos, Ryan Brady, Eli Gutkin, Zach Brennan, Hunter Babinec, and Trey Tuminelli.Once again, Hennelly never looks ahead at the schedule. “I don’t sneak a peek at two or three weeks down the line. Sometimes they (his other coaches) are breaking down film two weeks ahead of time to get a head start. I never do that. I always just worry about the team we’re playing that week, and my players know that, too.” 2019 marks just the second time that Hennelly has his entire coaching staff returning, something he view as important. “I have nine coaches; six of them played for me,” says Hennelly. “There’s a lot of alumni.” Hennelly is assisted by Henry Frayne, Barry Buchanan, Sean Morris, Kevin Karcich, Augie Meyer, Kevin Hennelly Jr., Tyler Bernsten, and Rob Goodwin, who coaches the freshmen.As Hennelly seeks to add to his career win total of 155, the Wolfpack will be tested right away by facing New Dorp of Staten Island, New York in their Friday, September 6 home opener. In fact, WMC will start the season with three consecutive home games before venturing to Randolph on Friday, September 27. “It’s the first year we’re playing them. I don’t know much about them,” says Hennelly about New Dorp, “but the little I’ve seen of them they’re very athletic. You have to beat good teams to have a good season. And then we have (West Morris) Mendham.”To follow all of the West Morris Central Wolfpack football action this season, visit www.wmcfootball.com. West Morris Central Wolfpack Look to An Exciting 2019 Season added by new_view_media on September 3, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Preschool Advantage, a Morristown-based non-profit organization established in 1995, that seeks to improve local communities by funding quality preschool for children of families in need, was recently awarded a $2,469 grant by The Morristown Rotary Club under their ‘Basic Education and Literacy’ focus area.  Preschool Advantage will use this grant for technology system upgrades to improve work efficiency and to enhance data security. Anneke Demarest, Director of Development thanked the Morristown Rotary Club said, “We really appreciate this grant. The time we save as a result of upgrading these systems can be directed at better serving our families in need.”Preschool Advantage focuses on families in need who have no options for sending their child to a quality preschool by funding tuition so the child does not miss out on this critical stage of early development. Studies have shown that children who attend a quality preschool are better educated, interact better with others, are healthier, and are more productive as adults than those who do not have this option. In 2019, Preschool Advantage will place its 1,000th child in preschool since its inception, with the organization having funded many of these children for two years of preschool. In the upcoming 2019-2020 school year Preschool Advantage will fund 100 students, up from 85 in 2018-2019. Children are placed in one of Preschool Advantage’s 25 partner preschools across Morris and Somerset counties. In Morristown there are three partner preschools: Children On The Green, The Nursery School Of The Presbyterian Church, and The Frances & Herbert Brody Preschool Of Temple B’nai Or.  Information about the organization can be found at www.preschooladvantage.org or by calling (973) 532-2501. The Morristown Rotary Club was established in 1922 to create positive change in their community and the world. The Club works within Rotary International’s six areas of focus, one of which is Basic Education and Literacy, through their own projects and programs or by supporting non-profit organizations that help Rotary meet its criteria.

      "How To Combat Cold And Flu(NAPSI)—According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), chances are good you’ll get a cold or the flu this year. Adults have an average of two to three colds per year and children have even more, while 5 to 20 percent of the population gets the flu. Fortunately, there are steps you can take to minimize your risk and ease your symptoms.Consider these tips from Chloraseptic® pharmacist spokesperson Maria Mantione:• Get a flu shot. The CDC recommends a flu shot for everyone over the age of 6 months. It’s easy to get—just talk to your pharmacist. It’s the best way to prevent the spread of the flu. It does not prevent the common cold, but the flu is a devastating, serious illness that could put you out of commission for a week or more or, even worse, land you in the hospital with pneumonia or infect someone you love with a weaker immune system—such as babies, the elderly or those undergoing chemotherapy.• Wash your hands often. Washing your hands with soap and water is the best way to prevent the spread of the common cold.• Prevent illness by practicing healthy habits. Make sure to get enough sleep, eat a balanced, nutritious diet, exercise and minimize stress.• If you do get sick, talk to your pharmacist about how to manage your symptoms with medications. Before cold season, stock your medicine cabinet with the essentials. Stick to single-ingredient products, so you have what you need to treat your specific symptoms. These include pain relievers and fever reducers, a decongestant, cough medicine, lozenges and a sore throat spray. Topical medications, such as Chloraseptic sore throat sprays and lozenges, are great to have on hand because they’re portable, can be used safely with other cold medicines and have very few side effects.In fact, Chloraseptic is the No. 1 sore throat relief brand around. It provides fast-acting relief for sore throats and mouth pain to help you get through your day.From lozenges that soothe nasal passages and suppress coughs to sprays that target pain when and where it hurts, there’s a broad portfolio of products based on your preferences and needs.The lozenges have a soothing liquid center that relieves pain and cools nasal passages. MAX Wild Berry is the strongest throat relief lozenge in the line. Chloraseptic Total offers a multisymptom lozenge formula that can suppress your cough for up to four hours.Chloraseptic’s sprays are the No. 1 pharmacist-recommended brand. The new and improved Cherry Spray tastes great, works on contact and is free of aspirin, sugar and gluten. The MAX Wild Berry Targeted Throat Spray is convenient for travel or to keep in your purse. The targeted spray makes it easier when you’re on the go to coat and protect specific areas in your mouth and throat. All these products are available at mass retailers, major drugstores and grocery stores.Also helping to keep you ahead of the flu this season is an online Cold + Flu tracker. To check for outbreaks and symptoms, go to www.chloraseptic.com, click on Cold + Flu Tracker and enter your zip code.How To Combat Cold And Flu added by new_view_media on December 22, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Helping Older People to Maintain Independence(NAPSI)—For most older adults, the ability to live independently is associated with the ability to drive. That’s one reason the prospect of eventually “giving up the keys” can be a frightening one.To help, the experts on aging at the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging (n4a) developed a brochure called “Before You Give Up the Keys: Create a Roadmap for Transportation Independence” that may lessen those fears by empowering older adults to evaluate their mobility needs, identify the transportation options in their community and develop a plan customized to their unique circumstances.“A too-familiar scenario is that older adults wait until they’re involved in some sort of emergency, like a traffic accident, before they really think about their driving ability and the other transportation options available to them in their community,” said n4a CEO Sandy Markwood. “Our goal is to shed light on a critical issue that will likely affect most families with an older loved one who may need to limit or eliminate their driving, and to provide a catalyst for discussion, and hopefully, action,” Markwood also noted.The n4a represents America’s national network of 623 Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs). It helps older adults and people with disabilities live with dignity and choices in their homes and communities for as long as possible.To that end, it created the Eldercare Locator.

      "Protect Your Health, Protect Your Toothbrush(NAPSI)—Did you know that keeping your toothbrush clean is a simple way to help protect your health and the health of your loved ones year-round, and especially during flu season?Dentists’ Advice for the Entire FamilyAccording to pediatric dentist Danielle Gilbert-Fowler, D.M.D., “Oral health is not just about your mouth, it’s about your overall health. The mouth is a major doorway for all sorts of microorganisms, which can be linked to anything from the common cold to heart disease and diabetes. Hence, the importance of having a healthy mouth cannot be overstated.”“More than 300 kinds of microorganisms thrive in the human mouth,” explains Astrid Shroetter, D.D.S. “What’s more, the typical toothbrush is reused for months and never cleaned thoroughly.”Research indicates that kids get sick on average about 10 times a year—that’s almost once a month. While dentists and parents both encourage good oral hygiene, it would be nice to do so without worrying about potential reinfection caused by brushing teeth with contaminated toothbrushes. As Dr. Gilbert-Fowler puts it, “You wouldn’t clean your house with a dirty washcloth. Why clean your teeth with a dirty toothbrush?”A Solution“It’s important to keep toothbrushes in a clean environment and separate from other toothbrushes,” recommends Gilbert-Fowler. “Use of a Steripod® clip-on toothbrush protector will help keep your toothbrush clean and protect against outside contaminants and cross contamination from other toothbrushes. It’s important for kids and adults alike to replace toothbrushes every three months or more frequently after any illness.”Developed by doctors and independently tested for efficacy at an accredited lab, Steripod is a clip-on protector that fits any standard or electric toothbrush. Using a patented natural vapor shield of thymol, derived from the thyme plant, Steripod keeps toothbrushes fresh and clean for up to three months. Simply clip it on your electric or manual toothbrush and it goes to work; no cables or batteries are needed. You can use it at home, work, the gym, school or when you travel.More Pearls of Wisdom for Your Pearly Whites:To further put the bite on dental disease, heed these five tips from the experts at the American Dental Association:1. Brush your teeth twice a day for two minutes with a soft-bristled brush.2. Replace your toothbrush every three or four months, or if the bristles are frayed.3. Use an ADA-accepted fluoride toothpaste.4. Clean between teeth daily with floss.5. Visit your dentist regularly for professional cleanings and oral exams.Learn MoreVisit www.GetSteripod.com or call (310) 204-7880.Protect Your Health, Protect Your Toothbrush added by new_view_media on December 22, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "6 Tips for Planning Your Wedding Photos Like a Pro\n",
      "Five words or less(NewsUSA) – With everything that goes into your wedding day, those once-in-a-lifetime moments will go by in a blur, which is why hiring a professional wedding photographer is a must. After all, the last thing you should be worrying about is whether your photographer will be able to capture your big day.\n",
      "The key? Prepare yourself so that you can accurately evaluate the “right” photographer for you.\n",
      "“The best photographer will take the time to build a rapport with you and use his or her experience and creativity to capture the mood, personality, ambiance and even the geography of your wedding,” says PPA (Professional Photographers of America) photographer Berit Bizjak. “The finest wedding photography is more than a series of still pictures. It’s physical poetry — it tells the story of the day and portrays the essence of both people and place.”\n",
      "To this end, PPA, the largest international nonprofit association created by professional photographers, has taken the guesswork out of the process by offering six tips to help you plan your wedding photos like a pro:\n",
      "1. Book far in advance. The best photographers get booked quickly — sometimes as much as a year in advance — so don’t wait until the last minute to book your photographer.\n",
      "2. Show them the money. Now is not the time to skimp on your photo budget. Call around and get a price range for services, and remember: after the cake is long gone, and the dress is stored away, your wedding photos will be the only things left to share and enjoy for years to come, so don’t cut too many corners on your photography budget — you’ll end up regretting it.\n",
      "3. Make sure your photographer is a real pro. Only hire someone who has liability insurance, experience taking the style of photos you want, backup equipment and a plan for when things go south. Ideally, he or she is a PPA photographer. PPA photographers do more than just snap pictures. They have the technical expertise and artistry to make you look your best and bring your vision to life. They also abide by a strict code of ethics that makes a real difference. Watch this (video) to see real married couples share their stories.\n",
      "4. Request to see a full gallery of real weddings. Look at full wedding coverage (not just a small selection of each wedding’s best moments) to see a photographer’s true style and get a sense of how he or she might tell your “story.” Do you prefer more artistic or traditional poses? Would you rather have a photojournalist approach or a mix of all styles?\n",
      "5.Work with your photographer to create a detailed shot list. PPA wedding photographers can also help you create that shot list, as they know what key moments tell a wedding story and can prepare for those. But talk about your must-haves, and walk through the entire program with your photographer ahead of time. Share your expectations ahead of time to ensure that he or she captures the key shots, while remaining attentive and available to catch the best candid moments.\n",
      "6. Plan your post-wedding photo strategy• ahead of time! Almost as soon as the festivities are over, you’ll be eager to look at the photos so you can relive your big day over and over again. Ask your photographer for teasers or a “sneak peek” and a timeline for when the rest of the pictures will be available. Will they give you an online gallery for family and friends to choose the images they want? Again, knowing these things ahead of time will make things easy on the back end, sparing you any heartache.6 Tips for Planning Your Wedding Photos Like a Pro added by new_view_media on December 22, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Wedding Gifts for Grooms: A Tradition Brides Shouldn’t Ignore\n",
      "Five words or less(NewsUSA) – The answer is: Yes, it’s expected.\n",
      "But it’s also a chance for all you brides out there to truly show you know that not everything is about you on your wedding day. That there really is another person involved (that would be the groom) who deserves a bit of recognition, too.\n",
      "We’re talking wedding presents — specifically, yours to your husband-to-be.\n",
      "Tradition does, indeed, hold that both you and he exchange gifts. And while it’s true that some guys are initially shocked to learn your engagement ring doesn’t also count as a “present,” that’s no excuse for you to waver.\n",
      "“Giving him something that’s just for him will make him feel really special,” advises BrideBox.com.\n",
      "Here’s what you need to know now that it’s prime time for weddings:\n",
      "* When to exchange them. Etiquette dictates that the hand-off occurs at one of three times: the night before the wedding, the morning of the ceremony, or right before leaving on your honeymoon. Think it’s bad luck to see the groom before the nuptials? “Many couples choose to courier gifts via bridesmaids or groomsmen just before the ceremony,” says Brides.com.\n",
      "* There’s a thin line between “romantic” and “mushy.” Some of you may be tempted to compile a “love notes” journal of every bit of correspondence you’ve ever sent your groom. Even assuming he’s the type who wouldn’t consider that a bit “over the top,” there’s always the chance he might be left wondering, “Okay, where’s my real present?”– especially if his gift to you is a serious piece of jewelry.\n",
      "* The consensus choice. There’s a reason a watch invariably makes everyone’s short list: It’s the perfect statement of who he is or aspires to be. (It’s also a lot more impressive than a flask, which for some reason also gets a few votes).\n",
      "No less a taste arbiter than MarthaStewartWeddings.com favors Baume & Mercier’s Clifton line — as elegant as the original 1950s model that inspired it — for the way it “easily transitions from big day to every day.” Like the Swiss watchmaker’s timelessly charming (and affordably luxurious) Classima line, it comes with a choice of straps, dial faces and a variety of what’s known as “small complications” that go way beyong just telling the hour. You can shop them at the Baume & Mercier e-boutique or by calling 1-800-MERCIER, where free engraving and wrapping are available.\n",
      "* Fun fact. One writer at AskMen.com says he’s “heard of women giving their husbands watches in the ceremony instead of a wedding ring.” If so, the answer is: No, just like your engagement ring, that wouldn’t also qualify as a wedding present.Wedding Gifts for Grooms: A Tradition Brides Shouldn’t Ignore added by new_view_media on December 22, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Want to Increase Revenue? Take Your Business Global(NAPSI)—International selling may seem daunting, but thanks to the Internet, it’s more attainable than ever. With the right tools in place, small businesses can go global and increase revenues without the headache.The question then is, “Where should I sell?” Consider these two destinations as you map out your plan for international growth:CanadaCanadians are e-commerce enthusiasts—in fact, 60 percent of Canada’s online shoppers buy from U.S.-based sellers. As an added bonus, there’s typically no language barrier for U.S. businesses selling into Canada.Given this opportunity for U.S. small businesses, the U.S. Postal Service opted to create zone-based pricing for all Priority Mail International® shipments headed to Canada starting on May 31, 2015.This means that the USPS will charge for shipping based on the U.S. origin ZIP code and the Canada destination postal code, instead of blending expensive routes into one flat rate.There will now be seven pricing zones for shipping. Some rates will increase, but for businesses in major cities—such as San Francisco, Miami and Chicago—savings will be around $8 per package.BrazilLatin America is the world’s second-fastest-growing e-commerce market, and leading this boom is Brazil. With 202 million citizens, of whom 33.5 million shop online, Brazil presents a huge opportunity for U.S.-based businesses looking to expand, though it’s not without its challenges.Due to delays in customs clearance, postal packages could take up to 20 days to arrive. Duties and taxes, as well as complicated custom forms, slow the process for both U.S. merchants and the buyers.However, there are solutions. Shipping technology company Endicia just launched a program called Endicia Global Service, which allows shipments from U.S. businesses to reach Brazilian customers in as little as 8 days. Additionally, duties and taxes can be paid by the buyer up front, and there are no complicated customs forms to fill out.“International selling is a great way to grow a business and secure additional revenue,” said Endicia co-founder and general manager Amine Khechfé. “These markets in particular are undergoing massive growth, and there’s never been a better time for small businesses to look into them.”To learn about the tools you need to succeed in going global, check out www.endicia.com/go-global.Want to Increase Revenue?

      "(BPT) – Remember free time? You used to have so much of it. But these days, work and family obligations have you running around constantly and you don’t know what to do first. You don’t even have time to do everything you have to do, let alone what you want to do.So how do you take back your day? How do you find the time to get things done and bring back some semblance of order? It is possible if you focus on making yourself more efficient. To help you accomplish all of your goals and find some free time as well, here are four ways you can improve your efficiency every single day.* Make a plan. When you’re running through your list of daily obligations the morning of, it’s easy to forget a thing or two, especially if you have children running around, phones ringing or dogs barking to distract you. Instead, plan out the upcoming day the night before. Make a list of everything you have to do and check these items against one another. Can two trips be combined? Are you prioritizing the most important things first? The better you can plan out your schedule, the more organized you’ll be the next day.* Get the news and information you need ASAP. You are bombarded by digital content every day and some of it is really important – but who has time to sift through it all? To help you find the information you need as quickly as possible, Fresly LLC launched a new app, iNews Photo. Whether you are on the go, or gathering news in your office this application allows you access to global and local news curated in real time by former journalist directly to your mobile phone or on a larger screen.* Set priorities. You don’t have time to do it all and maybe you don’t have to. Sit down and make a list of every social or professional group and obligation you belong to. Once you’ve made the list, look at it and ask yourself honestly how important this obligation is to you or your family. If you find the obligation is not essential, you’re better off to abandon it and save your time for the responsibilities that are more important to you.* Limit multitasking. Many people look to multitasking as an efficiency solution, but doing several things at once means it takes longer to accomplish any one task. And when the first task is completed, the result is often poorer because of it. Instead of trying to do several things at once, focus on the most important thing, accomplish it and move on.With today’s hectic schedules, finding the opportunity to do everything you’re supposed to do may seem impossible. However, if you apply the four tips listed above, you’ll improve your efficiency, stay up on the latest news and maybe even discover that elusive free time you sorely deserve. To learn more about how the iNews Photo app can help you find all of the information you need when you need it, and to download the app at Play.Google.com or iTunes.Apple.com, using the following code OGV1015.The 4-step plan to make your day more efficient added by new_view_media on November 15, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "medical workers working together in hospital(BPT) – Over the last decade, a number of changes have transformed the healthcare industry. The Affordable Care Act has enabled more than 16.4 million Americans to receive healthcare coverage. Advancements in technology improve both diagnoses and treatment quality. Retail health offers a convenience used by more than 10 million patients at 1,800 retail health locations. Along with the current challenges facing the healthcare system, such as an aging population, increased patient volume and physician shortages, these changes prompt the expansion of the traditional role of a nurse.Generally, Americans believe nurses’ roles are expanding as they share increased responsibilities to support the delivery of high quality healthcare, according to a poll commissioned by University of Phoenix College of Health Professions. The survey also found that adults in the United States view their experience with nurses as overwhelmingly positive. In fact, 95 percent found nurses to be a valuable addition to the healthcare system as a whole, and 87 percent view nurses as trusted sources of health information.“As nurses take on greater responsibility, and as the needs of healthcare organizations continue to grow more complex, the skills and training requirements of nurses must be prepared to match this growth,” says Betty Nelson, Ph.D., RN, and academic dean for University of Phoenix School of Nursing. “This is especially important given that the United States is currently facing a shortage of as many as 90,000 physicians by 2025.. Nurses with advanced education can help fill this shortage, particularly in areas where consumers do not have access to care.”Because of this, employers are looking for nurses with a variety of skills and certifications including:* Additional degrees or seeking an advanced degree* In-demand skills such as bilingualism, leadership and critical thinking* Flexibility and professionalism* The desire to grow into advanced practitioners such as nurse practitioners and physician assistants* Specialized training for working with various populations* An openness to diverse opportunities in a number of different facilitiesIn order to keep up with the changes in the healthcare system, at least 80 percent of the nation’s nursing workforce will need a bachelor’s degree by 2020 and the number of nurses with doctoral degrees will need to be double, according to the Institute of Medicine. Nursing education institutions play a critical role in meeting the needs of today’s healthcare system. Nurses need a place to obtain these degrees and further their skills within the healthcare industry. Institutions recognize the expanding role of the 21st century nurse and are offering a wide range of curriculum and degree programs that address recent changes in the delivery of primary care. Graduates need to be equipped with the skills they need to succeed in today’s health care market.It’s now more important than ever that nurses have the training and skills to match the demands of the growing profession. Along with the nursing community, institutions that offer nursing degree programs must work together to enhance and better prepare the nursing workforce.What employers look for in the 21st century nurse added by new_view_media on November 15, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "(BPT) – What image does the word “grilling” bring to mind? Do you envision thick, juicy burgers or steaks? What about sauce-slathered chicken breasts sizzling over coals? Cooking out is one of the great joys of warm weather, but if you leave side dishes out of your grilling plans – or stick with cold sides like salads – you’re missing out on some great flavors.Side dishes give you a chance to really show off your grilling chops, savor the farm fresh flavors of summer harvests, and indulge in wholesome, organic fare. Here are six summer side dishes that go great on the grill:1. Corn on the cob – If you’ve always wanted to try grilling vegetables but weren’t sure which of your favorites would go well on the grill – take heart! Virtually any veggie can be prepared on a grill, but corn becomes a show-stopper when grilled. Remove the husks and silk and toss the cobs right on a preheated grill. Watch them careful and keep turning them to ensure they brown but don’t burn. The heat from the grill causes the natural sugars in the corn to carmelize, and you’ll end up with the sweetest sweet corn you ever tasted!2. Fries – A trip to the grocery store or farmer’s market for fresh produce may not fit in your schedule if you’re grilling on the fly. There’s good news – frozen options like Alexia Organic Oven Crinkles with Sea Saltdeliver farm to flavor taste when prepared on the grill or in the oven. Made from Pacific Northwest russet potatoes, Alexia’s organic fries are sprinkled with bright sea salt to bring out even more of the rich flavor that Mother Nature delivered. Make a tray out of aluminum foil, spread the Oven Crinkles in a single layer, and grill for about 20-25 minutes at 400-450 degrees F. Turn once or twice during the cooking process.3. Tomatoes – If you’ve only grilled small tomatoes on a kabob, or never tried grilled tomatoes at all, this is your summer to discover grilling tomatoes couldn’t be easier. Start with large, meaty tomatoes – a variety that’s dense and has fewer seeds works best. Slice in half, brush with your favorite seasoned oil and place the halves cut-side down on the grill. Cook for 3-5 minutes on each side. Top with your favorite cheese when done.4. Kale – Grilling greens like kale helps all those wonderful nutrients and flavor stay in the vegetable and don’t disappear into the cooking water – which is what can happen when you boil veggies on the stovetop. Grilling kale couldn’t be easier. You can adapt virtually any of your favorite kale recipes to grilling by tossing the kale with the recipe seasonings and some oil. Arrange the seasoned leaves in a single layer on the grill and they’ll cook to crispy splendor in just minutes.5. Cheese – A slice of gooey melted cheese is the crowning glory atop your grilled burger, but cheese can also handle the grill on its own, and be a delicious, different side dish or appetizer. Many cheeses will work on the grill, and you can find recommendations for the best cheeses to cook on the grill with a simple online search. Slice your chosen cheese in thick pieces. Most grilling cheeses will need minimal seasoning and little or no oil. Generally, cheese takes just a minute or two to brown each side and allow the inside to melt.6. Dinner rolls – Craving dinner rolls to go with that thick juicy steak, but in no mood to fire up the oven when it’s 90 degrees outside? You can make frozen dinner rolls on the grill. Choose your favorite variety, such as Alexia Artisan French Rolls or Artisan Focaccia Rolls, set your gas grill to the temperature recommended on the package’s directions, wrap the rolls in foil and place directly on the grill. Keep an eye on the rolls to ensure they don’t burn as they can cook quickly on a grill.6 summer sides you never knew you could grill added by new_view_media on April 3, 2016View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "(BPT) – Traditional wedding rules have fallen by the wayside – food trucks are in, having a hashtag is a must, bridesmaids no longer wear the same dress and groomsmen are sometimes in sneakers. Couples are actively seeking ways to differentiate themselves and get creative. All that aside, there is one thing that remains constant – weddings must have wine.Without wine, there is no glass to raise during the toast to the bride and groom and nothing to drink when the bar closes during dinner. Wine is the first thing guests are offered when they take a seat, and – you know that they say – it’s important to make a good first impression.Choosing the right varietals for your wedding does not have to be a stressful endeavor. Whether you’re a novice wine drinker or a connoisseur, follow these four tips and you’ll please a crowd without spending a fortune:Say “cheers!” with a sparkling wine.People love a good toast, and nothing washes down a teary maid of honor speech like a glass of sparkling. Riondo Prosecco is an accessible option that’s ideal to enjoy any day of the year, but perfectly suited for special occasions. You’ll get six pours out of a bottle, so plan accordingly!Good things come in threes.In addition to a sparkling, you’ll want a red and a white option that are familiar and food-friendly. You can’t go wrong with a Merlot – look for labels from the Napa region. For a white, Terlato Friuli Pinot Grigio is exceptional and ideal for food pairing.Wine math: What you didn’t learn in school.Running out of wine mid-wedding isn’t an option, so it’s important to do the math. You should anticipate getting about 5 glasses per bottle and assume that each guest will drink one glass per hour. Follow this rule and the wine will flow all night long, keeping you and your guests happy.Don’t break the bank, but stay away from the cheap stuff.Choosing an excellent wine doesn’t mean paying top-dollar, but buying too cheap can mean sacrificing quality. There are countless high-quality, delicious, wines available for $10-$20 per bottle, so leave the cheap stuff on the bottom shelf!4 wine buying tips for weddings added by new_view_media on April 3, 2016View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "(BPT) – Around-the-clock food shows, celebrity guests and niche themed restaurants are just a few reasons the fine food movement continues to experience extraordinary growth. In 2016, more people will be seeking upscale dining experiences that focus on the unique to the luxurious — and they’re willing to pay big bucks to do so.In fact, Americans said they would splurge an average of $203 in order to have a once-in-a-lifetime dining experience at a gourmet restaurant, according to a recent online survey by Harris Poll sponsored byMichelin, the global tire maker that publishes the popular restaurant guide.What’s surprising is the people willing to pay the most for fine dining experiences are younger generations. Millennials (ages 18-34) on average would pay $282 for this culinary experience, compared to diners ages 45-54 who would shell out $170, and $122 for those 65 and older.One explanation for why younger diners are willing to pay so much is that they want to enjoy more than just fine cuisine. Many restaurants offer an overall experience that will be remembered long after the last morsel of food is gone. Whether it’s an incredible atmosphere, the opportunity to observe the chef work or gaining access to foods and cooking styles never available before, this desire for an experience is driving younger diners to invest in upscale dining.As America looks at the most recent Michelin star ratings to navigate the nation’s best eateries, there are some food and restaurant trends that are positioned to grow in 2016. Chefs will continue to expand their creative prowess by experimenting with new cooking styles and food fusions. Cooking methods will blend with science and art to create uniquely fine fare with a story that is as intriguing as the taste.Diversity is another notable trend for 2016. Authentic ethnic cuisine is in high demand and restaurants are answering the call. Traditional restaurants will begin to offer diverse plates in addition to timeless favorites to appeal to a wide range of palates. Expect to see more ancient grains, ethnic spices and worldly condiments at eateries in the future.Conscious dining is a growing trend thanks to diners’ increasing awareness of where their food comes from. Hyper-local sourcing of ingredients is being adopted by many notable restaurants. This includes growing fresh herbs and vegetables onsite and partnering with local farms for incredibly fresh dairy and meat products. Sustainable seafood partnerships are another effort by restaurants that supports the increasing demand for responsible dining options.Finally, diners are seeking chefs with the best reputation for tried-and-true favorites. That means the city’s chef with a reputation for curating and cooking the best steak will have a wait list. Supporting this nod toward the traditional, the Michelin survey found a quarter of U.S. adults say steakhouse cuisine is their favorite choice for dining. What’s the runner up? Italian ranked as the second choice nationally for the meal of a lifetime.Which 2016 dining trend do you want to try most? added by new_view_media on April 3, 2016View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "(BPT) – Snacks, produce, drinks or sweets – if it is a seasonal offering, Americans are anxiously awaiting it. According to Nielsen, Americans spend about $374 billion annually on snack foods. For many of those snack lovers, items that are only available for a limited time are one of the major highlights of seasonal occasions and holidays, especially this time of year when, according to a recent Cheetos brand survey, 65 percent of Americans profess their love of seasonal Easter treats.Whether your favorite holiday arrives in spring, summer, winter or fall, seasonal treats can sweeten your enjoyment of the season. No one wants to miss the coveted special flavors and offerings that appear on store shelves for short stints and are quickly cleared out by that clever “seasonal snack stockpiler” who is always one step ahead of you. So here’s your guide to the top treats to watch for this spring, and throughout the year.SpringIt might still be too chilly to feel like spring in some areas of the country, but St. Patrick’s Day undoubtedly marks the start of the springtime snacking season. Milkshake lovers will kick things off with mint-green milkshakes, and quickly turn their attention to Easter candies and snacks.Chocolate and marshmallow sweets are the traditional stars of Easter baskets across the country – for both the young, and the young at heart. It is no surprise that 71 percent of parents who celebrate Easter admit to sneaking snacks from their kids’ baskets, according to the Cheetos survey.Of course, everyone is familiar with jelly beans, peanut butter eggs, chocolate bunnies and marshmallow chicks, but the majority of consumers say they desire more variety beyond just candy. This year, there’s a new must-try alternative to satisfy the search for something beyond the candy animal monotony. Cheetos Sweetos, the cinnamon-sugar version of everyone’s favorite cheddar cheese snacks is reappearing in stores — and Easter baskets — this spring, but only for a limited time. Launched in 2015, Sweetos snacks are the perfect, and delicious, twist on Easter snacking.SummerFrozen treats are the highlight of summer, but not just the ice cream quarts you find year-round in the freezer cases at your local grocer. Summer means the ice cream truck will be rolling through neighborhood streets, sounding that familiar melodic “come and get it” tune and serving up frozen favorites that you just can’t find anywhere else —  or at any other time of year.You can’t go wrong with the missile-shaped, multi-colored ice pops that beckon from beside a myriad of fruit-flavored cream pops, or reliable favorites like ice cream sandwiches and chocolate-topped cones. And don’t forget snow cones — the refreshing shaved ice in perfect spheres mounted on a paper funnel and topped with your favorite sweet flavoring!FallOf course everyone knows fall is pumpkin season — and you should take every chance to enjoy all things pumpkin-flavored this time of year, from coffee and ice cream to bread, cake and pie.However, autumn also heralds state fair season across the country — and the arrival of a variety of innovative sweet treats that can only be enjoyed among the unique surroundings of fair rides, tickets and games. Funnel cakes are a state fair staple, and what could be better when the weather gets nippy than enjoying lightly sweetened, deep-fried dough dusted heavily with confectioner’s sugar? Depending on where you live in the country and which fair you attend, you can find over-the-top sweets and snacks such as deep-fried ice cream, fried candy bars and even pretzel-encrusted brownies deep-fried on a stick.WinterOf course, winter holidays are the pinnacle of seasonal snacking. From the final weeks of pumpkin season to the eggnog, candy canes and baked goods associated with holiday moments from Thanksgiving through New Year’s, winter serves up a buffet of food and snacks that are available at no other time of year.Winter’s arrival means anticipated delicacies like gingerbread-flavored everything, bite-sized candy favorites that marry mint and chocolate in holiday shapes, and of course the much-maligned and equally beloved fruit cake all hit store shelves just in time to make the holiday party circuit!Whatever your preference — savory, salty or sweet — make sure to enjoy these snacking staples throughout the year. But remember that seasonal treats come and go quickly, so be ready to grab a bag of Sweetos snacks, remember to listen for the ice cream truck’s playful tune, try your state’s delicacies and fill stockings with enough gingerbread cookies or mint-themed chocolate drops to last through the end of the year!Don’t miss these must-have snacks that define each season of the year added by new_view_media on April 3, 2016View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Be Well Tressed Every Day With Wigs(NAPSI)—Changing your hair to suit your hat, your mood or your outfit-or to make holidays and other celebrations that much more special—can be easier and more fun than ever.TV Star’s IdeaExplains Daytime Emmy Award winner Sherri Shepherd, “When I was a little girl, I would hear all this commotion in my house from my mom, aunts and grandmother when picking out their wigs for the day. It was such a good time for them and was a major part of their everyday beauty routines. Ever since then, I’ve watched the women in my household glow with confidence because they would customize their look day by day through the use of faux hair. My grandmother had a wig that she would pick out and wear perfectly with specific hats. My mother had an Angela Davis ‘power to the people’ wig. Watching these iconic women in my life pair their hair lengths, styles and colors with particular hats, outfits and personalities was exciting. Getting ready to go out was like an event in and of itself. Wigs are the perfect way for the inner diva in all women to come out and get creative, which is why I was inspired to start my own wig line to give women the choices to create their own style and look.“I always say, you were born with the hair you’ve got—now get the hair you want. Short and sassy, long and sexy or curly and fierce; you can easily change your hairstyle and transform your whole look to fit whatever your day brings. This is one of the reasons I wanted to create my line of wigs for Luxhair—I wanted to be able to give busy women high-quality, versatile looks to choose from that were simple and quick to put on but that were affordable and wouldn’t break their budget too.”The result is the Luxhair Now by Sherri Shepherd high-fashion wig and extension collection. “The collection provides the look you want, the style you want and the perfect accent to make a personal style statement, now.”Why WigsLike putting on your most stylish shoes and more powerful than a red lipstick, Shepherd says, these high-fashion styles can add some fabulous to your everyday. They can also be an excellent accessory to have during the holiday season when you want a party perfect ‘do but don’t want to spend a lot of time getting it. With a variety of lace front styles that give the appearance of natural hair growth, allow for styling away from the face and heat-friendly fiber, these wigs stand up to heat and humidity, offer styling options, and look, feel and move like real hair.What’s NewNow that Luxhair Now by Sherri Shepherd has partnered with national retailer Sally Beauty Supply, two new fun wig styles are available in over 1,900 stores nationwide.• Textured Pixie is a sassy pixie wig that features choppy texture for maximum volume and style along with precision-cut bangs that frame the face.

      "On National Senior Citizens Day, Three Ways To Celebrate The Older Generation(NAPSI)—Whether it’s your parents, grandparents, aunt, uncle or neighbor, you likely received guidance from or looked to older people in your life as you’ve tried to become more independent and deal with change and everyday challenges. August 21 is National Senior Citizens Day, and it’s an ideal time to honor seniors for the wisdom and care they have provided us, and also to celebrate the members of the older generation by finding ways to enhance their lives as they age.There’s No Place Like HomeNearly 90 percent of seniors want to age in place—stay in their own homes as they get older. But one out of three seniors suffers a fall each year, according to the CDC. Making an older person’s home as safe as possible is integral to helping him or her maintain this independence. Walking through seniors’ daily routine with them, from the time they get out of bed to when they go back to sleep, can reveal patterns in how they navigate their home and any potential hazards. By identifying the areas of concern and making necessary adjustments, you can decrease the risk of an accident and seniors can reside more confidently in their own home.Stay ConnectedTechnology now allows grandparents to FaceTime their children and grandchildren across the globe or even in the next town, and seniors to reconnect with classmates of decades past via Facebook. Older generations can create, build and maintain quality social relationships with the convenience and ease of social media. Seniors have a multitude of online outlets to share updates, photos and videos with loved ones. To help them stay in touch, ensure that the seniors in your life have reliable Internet connectivity, and help them set up social media accounts if they don’t have one already. In-person interaction is ideal, but keeping in touch through computers, tablets and smartphones is a great way to supplement seeing and speaking with each other.Everyone’s Wearing TechnologyWearable technology like the Apple Watch is popular among younger audiences, but wearable fitness trackers and medical alert devices can provide great benefits to seniors as well. In the event of a fall or accident where it’s impossible to get to a phone to call for help, a medical alert device immediately connects the injured to emergency services. Because that person’s medical history and health needs are on file, first responders can more easily treat them. With help a push of a button away, medical alert devices give seniors peace of mind even beyond health concerns. In fact, a recent survey by Bay Alarm Medical found that 80 percent of medical alert device wearers worry less when their adult children travel because they feel the device provides an adequate support system. If you decide to help protect the senior in your life with a wearable medical alert system, it’s also wise to look for a caring, people-first, ethical provider. Bay Alarm Medical, for example, implemented a Code of Ethics it follows for uncompromisingly ethical and transparent business practices. The company vows to prioritize customers over sales, make pricing publicly accessible and never pressure customers into a product or service they do not need, among other safeguards.National Senior Citizens Day is a day to commemorate the great ways in which seniors have helped us and we should show them how thankful we are every day. Simple steps such as a home safety walk-through, staying connected and providing the tools to enhance their physical and emotional well-being can go a long way in reducing the stress of aging for seniors and their loved ones.On National Senior Citizens Day, Three Ways To Celebrate The Older Generation added by new_view_media on December 24, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Don’t Let The Flu Mean Missing Memorable Moments(NAPSI)—While the cold and flu season often coincides with holiday celebrations and family get-togethers, there are preventative measures that families can take to stay healthy and not miss out.To help you get to the next “can’t miss” life event, consider these top preventative tips:• Get an annual flu shot. It’s the most effective way to help prevent the spread of influenza. For your convenience, you can get a vaccine at any of the more than 7,800 CVS/pharmacy and 900 MinuteClinic locations across the country. The flu shot is available every day with no appointment needed, including evenings and weekends.As a preventive service under the Affordable Care Act, it’s fully covered and available at no cost through most insurance plans, including Medicare Part B.The pharmacy can also be a one-stop shop for flu prevention resources, including over-the-counter cold and flu remedies, multivitamins and anti-bacterial cleaning products. Plus, anyone enrolled in the ExtraCare Rewards program gets a 20 percent off CVS Shopping Pass upon getting the flu shot in most places.• Seniors, take extra precaution. There’s a high-dose flu shot designed for those 65 and older, who have a greater risk of severe illness from the flu.• Plan ahead: the earlier, the better. It takes up to two weeks for your immunity to build up after getting a flu shot. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone who is at least 6 months old get a flu shot as soon as the vaccine is available.• Stay home if you’re ill. While it may seem like a no-brainer, two-thirds of employed Americans would still go to work even if they were feeling ill with flu-like symptoms. It’s important to understand the preliminary symptoms of the flu and, if you experience them, to stay home. This will help bolster your immune system and prevent the germs spreading.• Practice healthy habits. Door handles, desks and other everyday items are ridden with germs. Wash your hands frequently with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds and avoid touching your mouth and eyes. Additionally, eat nutritious foods, drink plenty of water, and get sufficient sleep to keep your immune system in top shape. Lead by example to educate children about these habits.Learn MoreFor further information and to find a nearby store, visit www.cvs.com/flu or download the CVS/pharmacy mobile app.Don’t Let The Flu Mean Missing Memorable Moments added by new_view_media on December 24, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Medicare Open Enrollment: What You Need To Knowby Patricia Smith(NAPSI)—Every year, millions of Medicare beneficiaries must decide which Medicare Advantage (MA) plan will best serve their needs. During Medicare’s annual open enrollment period, October 15-December 7, you can change MA plans or enroll in one for the first time. Important factors to consider include premium costs, choice of doctors and plan benefits. But there is one other important question: What is the quality rating of the plan?Quality is important because it means better health care and the best value for your money. Medicare uses a system called Star Ratings to assess the quality of plans, awarding plans from one to five stars. These ratings are based on many factors, such as how well the plan does in keeping people healthy and preventing illness, how quickly you can get an appointment and see specialists, and how the plan responds to your complaints and concerns.Today, 65 percent of MA enrollees are in plans with four stars or more, compared to 17 percent in 2009. Eight of the 12 MA plans earning five stars this year are members of the Alliance of Community Health Plans, an organization representing high-quality health plans.You can learn more about MA plans using the Medicare Plan Finder at www.Medicare.gov. The National Committee for Quality Assurance also evaluates quality in MA plans at www.ncqa.org.• Ms. Smith is the president and CEO of the Alliance of Community Health Plans, www.achp.org.Medicare Open Enrollment: What You Need To Know added by new_view_media on December 24, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "How To Plan A Smooth Group Ski Trip(NAPSI)—According to a study from Wyndham Vacation Rentals, most travelers take ski and snowboard vacations in groups of four or more. Hitting the slopes with a big group doesn’t have to be hard, even when it comes to coordinating everyone’s schedules and travel arrangements.Group Ski Trip TipsWhile it can be challenging to keep everyone happy during the vacation, these planning hints can help get everyone started on the right foot.• Find the right lodging. When traveling with a larger group, alternative lodging options might be your best bet. A cabin, condo or home lets everyone stay together under one roof without sacrificing privacy. Everyone can have his or her own bedroom, while common spaces such as a living room or dining room make spending time together easy. Most rental homes also feature a kitchen, which can cut down on the stress of dining out as a large group. Have everyone take a night to prepare dinner. You’ll not only save money, you’ll enjoy time together without the interruptions of a busy restaurant.• Plan for transportation. When researching lodging, see if your accommodations rest along a community shuttle route or offer their own shuttle services. Also look into the destination’s transit systems. Sun Valley, for example, offers free bus service. If you’re renting a car, make sure you plan for times when the group splits up. Leaving half the group stranded won’t make for a fun situation.• Agree on activities beforehand. While skiing and snowboarding may be the top priorities, there are plenty of other activities to do during a ski trip. From dogsledding and snow tubing to unique local festivals, you might find attractions you just don’t want to miss. Have everyone weigh in on top choices before the trip, especially those who are attending but who aren’t avid skiers or snowboarders. Considering everyone’s preferences in advance can help reduce stress during the trip itself.• Give everyone some downtime. Opinions often differ, especially within larger groups, so allow for flexibility during the trip. If your muscles are begging for a break, read a book or squeeze in a post-run nap while your fellow travelers stay on the slopes. If half of the group wants to head downtown for the afternoon while the other half wants to get in another mountain activity, split up for a few hours. By staying flexible with the group’s itinerary, you’ll avoid any tension and better enjoy the time you all spend together.Learn MoreTo start your planning now, you can visit www.WyndhamVacationRentals.com for deals on vacation rental homes in some of North America’s top ski destinations.How To Plan A Smooth Group Ski Trip added by new_view_media on December 22, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Triple Sorghum Granola(Family Features) As you look to the new year with plans for healthier habits, there’s no better place to start than the beginning – the beginning of each day, that is. Countless studies have shown the benefits of a nutritious breakfast as part of a healthy eating plan, and there are plenty of options to make a good-for-you breakfast that tastes great, too.Experts agree that there are numerous health benefits to breakfast. For example, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics credits breakfast with helping brain function and memory as well as preventing tiredness and overeating as the day wears on. Mayo Clinic staff adds that adults who eat breakfast are likely to consume more vitamins and minerals, and less fats and cholesterol.Wake up your morning routine with these tips for a healthier start to each day:Plan a well-rounded meal. Incorporate whole grains, like sorghum, lean protein, low-fat dairy and fruits and vegetables, for a nutrient-rich meal that will keep you fueled and feeling full until lunch time.Experiment with new flavors. Avoid burnout and boredom by trying new foods. For example, substitute your typical grain with sorghum, an American-grown cereal grain. In addition to its delicious flavor, sorghum is a highly versatile ingredient that is naturally high in fiber, iron and protein and can be used in a wide range of preparations.Eliminate obstacles. If hectic mornings are preventing you from getting a healthy breakfast, find solutions that work for you and your family. Prepare make-ahead foods that you can heat in minutes or look for options that are easy to eat on the go, such as this Triple Sorghum Granola, which can be made ahead and stored in an airtight container to maintain its crunchy texture.Find more ideas for incorporating sorghum into your healthy new year at Facebook.com/TasteSorghum.

      " The Morris County Board of Freeholders invites the public to join them in observing the 14th anniversary of 9/11 at a Remembrance Service and Candlelight Vigil on Sun., Sept. 13.The ceremony will begin at 5 p.m. at the Morris County September 11th Memorial on West Hanover Avenue in Parsippany-Troy Hills, across from the Morris View Healthcare Center and adjacent to the Morris County Public Safety Academy.The event will include a march with a color guard up West Hanover Avenue to the Memorial by police, fire, rescue and emergency personnel from across Morris County.The observance will include a special invocation, a lighting of candles, and reading of the names of each of the Morris County victims, plus a 21-gun salute, and keynote remarks.Elizabeth Schrier, the widow of the late Freeholder Jack Schrier, who was instrumental in getting Morris County’s 9/11 Memorial constructed, will carry the American flag during the ceremony.Morris County’s September 11th Memorial pays tribute to all of those who died in the terrorist attacks in New York, Pennsylvania and Washington D.C., on Sept. 11, 2001, with a special emphasis on the 64 victims from Morris County whose names are etched in plaques that are affixed to the Memorial.The names of all of the nearly 3,000 people who died that day are engraved in ruby-colored paving stones that have been set in the ground as a walkway surrounding the Memorial.“It is vitally important to gather each year on the anniversary of 9/11 to recall every single one of the nearly 3,000 people who were tragically lost to us on that day, including 64 of our Morris County residents,’’ said Freeholder Director Kathy DeFillippo. “Their families and friends should know that the lives of their loved ones will never be forgotten.’’Since seating at the Memorial is limited, the public is encouraged to bring lawn chairs to the outdoor observance. Parking will be available at the Morris County Department of Human Services building at 340 West Hanover Ave., in Morris Township – across from the Academy. Shuttle buses will be available to transport those in need to the Memorial.The freeholders also invite police and fire departments and rescue squads from across the county to participate by sending one apparatus per department and assembling at 6 p.m. at the Morris County Public Safety Academy, 500 West Hanover Ave., in Parsippany-Troy Hills.

      "Morris Arts recently opened a 15th exhibit, entitled Black, White and Green at the Gallery in Morristown.  Guest curator Katherine Murdock, the Exhibition Committee of Morris Arts and the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation selected works by several outstanding artists in New Jersey and New York.\n",
      "Inspired by the biowall, the vertical garden of living plants within the exhibit space, Murdock chose to focus the exhibit on plants and selected the title, Black, White and Green, to purposefully reflect that limited color palette as a means of unifying the exhibit. What is striking, however, is the richness and variety of the artists’ unique approaches to the theme – through their use of different media (collage, oil, cold wax painting, photography, charcoal drawings, wood sculpture, etc.), composition, and subtle gradations of color.As Murdock notes, “Casey Ruble’s paper collage illustrates a bundled bouquet of invasive plant species and Kathy Cantwell’s oil and cold wax on panel explores green color fields that resemble landscape. Richard Bottwin uses plant material as a medium and highlights the wood grain with stain and paint.”The public is invited to view this exciting exhibit, open Mon.-Fri. from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and by appointment, and will remain on display until Aug. 24.  Visit www.morrisarts.org<https://www.morrisarts.org or call 973- 285-5115 for additional information.Morris Arts located in Morristown is a not-for-profit organization founded in 1973 dedicated to building community through the artsBlack, White, Green Art Exhibit Featured In Gallery added by new_view_media on March 19, 2016View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Locals Volunteer To Build A Better Life In GuatemalaBy Cheryl ConwayBeyond the conditions many can relate to, outside the walls of what’s the norm, exists a world so difficult to imagine unless one visits and reaches out to help.In Guatemala City, 11,000 people- in which 7,000 are kids- live and work inside a garbage dump.“Most survive by picking through the trash to earn less than five dollars a day. Many find their daily food in the dump.”Just when all hopelessness is lost for these human beings living in one of the most impoverished areas , more and more volunteers are stepping up to assist and steer them to a better life. Some local people have become very involved and formed an organization known as Beyond The Walls. This month, 75 individuals are volunteering to visit the Guatemala City Garbage Dump to build houses, donate clothing and shoes and organize sport clinics.The non-profit organization started in 2007 at the Mendham Hills Community Church, although mission teams were sent out before.“We had been going to Guatemala for a couple of years,” explains Betsy Ahl of Morris Township, executive director of Beyond The Walls. “The church was sending mission teams. We asked volunteers to help raise money to help pay for trips, build houses. They’d raise more money and that would go toward projects.”In order to influence others outside the church to get involved, and to receive matching grants from volunteers’ employers, organizers decided to expand the church group to a secular, non-profit organization, explains Ahl.The idea to help the people of Guatemala dates back to 2005, when Mendham was named one of the top wealthiest places to live in America.“The elders of Mendham Hills Chapel thought this wasn’t how others lived,” explains Ahl, “so they asked the chairman of the missions’ team to find an area that needed help.”One of the poorest places in the world, the Guatemala City Garbage Dump, was identified by a church member and the idea to team up with the Potter’s House organization, with a mission to eradicate poverty, build houses, help others get business loans and establish community programs.“It’s a ravine right in the center of the Capitol City,” describes Ahl. “They’ve been filling it up with garbage for 50 years.”In their first mission, Ahl joined 26 others for four days. The group, after that, “could have gone to Africa one year, China one year,” but the group decided it was more important to “come back and form long term relationships,” says Ahl who has sponsored three kids in Guatemala in the Kids In Potter House Education Program, in which 50 kids are sponsored to receive an education. Ahl has been sponsoring these kids since they were in the first grade, are now graduating high school and will be supported through college.Church member and organization volunteer, Mike Rubright, 50, of Long Valley, is currently on one of three missions to Guatemala this month through Beyond The Walls. His ninth trip out there during the past seven years, Rubright and his daughter, Erin, are working in the garbage dump from July 18-25.Another one of his daughters, Emily, has gone on the trip seven times but had to miss this one. Youth volunteers must be starting atleast seventh grade to participate, so for Erin this is her third trip. Volunteers must contribute $1,600 each in order to participate, with funds going toward flight and lodging; and additional funds to supplies and building houses. Every year, Rubright sends letters and emails to friends requesting donations to help support his volunteer work.About 75 people have signed up through Beyond The Walls to volunteer during the three missions this month, with 10 people from the Mendham, Long Valley and Chester areas. The others are from areas throughout the country such as Florida, New York and Texas, who formed their own groups with Beyond The Walls.Rubright and his wife, Katie, have a niece who was adopted from Guatemala so their connection is even greater.“I do construction all day long,” says Rubright. “I had no idea what I was doing; I had no construction experience. Now I’m the person in charge of construction projects my week.“Everybody builds, everybody works; it doesn’t matter how old you are,” says Rubright, principal at the Woodglen Middle School in Lebanon Twp.“We build a concrete block house with a concrete floor,” he explains. “We mix concrete by hand; it’s the hardest thing I’ve ever done. The girls and women work harder than I’ve ever seen; they don’t stop.” A family that is getting a house built works beside the volunteers.“It’s not very big,” he says, with the homes about 15 feet by 15 feet,” the size of a bedroom. Homes are for four to five person families, and sometimes six to eight people.It’s like “nine people living in the size of your kitchen,” describes Ahl. Homes are built side by side and cost $5,600 to build.A completed house consists of one big room with one eight-foot partition wall that separates the bedrooms from “everything else,” says Rubright. “They have a toilet and a shower stall” in an area about the size of a closet, and they get “a big concrete sink” that can weigh up to 600 pounds, which is used for all washing needs such as dishes and clothes.Rubright also works under Guatemala masons who are very particular with how they want things to be completed, he says.“They tell us what to do,” says Rubright. “There are a lot of times we do things that don’t make sense; you can’t tell them they are wrong. That’s frustrating. If they tell you to put a hole in a concrete pipe with a hammer and nails, instead of a drill, you do it.”The homes that are being built for the people in the Guatemala City Garbage Dump is luxury compared to the “cardboard sheet metal,” dirt, chemicals, methane gas that surround them and sicken them while living in the dump and “breathing the trash.”These houses also provide shelter and protection for these people, says Rubright, as gun shots are commonly fired in the garbage dump.His goal during this one week visit is to build three to five houses with his group of volunteers.Potter’s House has built 110 homes to date, with 75 contributed by the volunteers of Beyond The Walls, says Ahl, who visits four times, about six weeks a year.In addition to building homes, the volunteers lead soccer clinics and donate uniforms, soccer balls and cleats as well as baseball clinics and donations of t-shirts; help at a medical clinic, vacation Bible school, and deliver groceries and visit families.Through their efforts, much progress has been made such as concrete roads, a community center built last year, education programs which is much needed as the average kid does not go past fifth grade in Guatemala, says Rubright.“A lot of families look at education as not important,” says Rubright. “A lot end up working in the garbage dump” as scavengers. “They make money picking out recyclables. People sift through trash looking through recyclables to see what they can sell” or “they are looking for food to eat it.” Parents stop sending their kids to school because they need their school age kids to watch younger siblings so parents can work.If they are not scavengers, they rely on the garbage dump to sell their own goods, like tortillas to the scavengers so they can eat, and even jewelry, says Ahl.“It’s just this culture of poverty,” says Ahl, with high unemployment. “Education is not a value, that’s the bottom line. Potter’s House tries to teach the value of education especially to the parents.” It also tries to teach the vendors who do sell inside the garbage dump to sell on the outside, says Ahl.“But without education, it’s really, really hard to move their way out of the dump,” says Ahl.Scavengers are even making less these days. As the economy declined, so did the value of recyclables, explains Rubright. For those working 10 to 12 hour days, they are making two to three dollars.While “there are guns everywhere, “Rubright admits that he feels safe when there.“The organization we are with is well respected,” he says, and they stay in a retreat center with accommodations like that of a motel or college dorm. “We are safe; every store has an armed guard,” and no one walks alone. “We have relationships with people. We go to the same neighborhoods. There’s more of a comfort level now. It’s a safe place- I bring my kids there I’m not in fear of our lives.”It is the desire to help others and the appreciation that brings Rubright back to the dump.He says, “If there’s really a God, why does he let that happen? We let it happen by not choosing to use our resources that way. I don’t think I could not go back. They have so little but they appreciate everything they have. We have so much and we want so much more.”They say, “This morning I lived in a garbage dump; now I live in a mansion.”Rubright admits, “I’ve learned more from them than they get from me. I’m a better person in Guatemala than I am here.”Also nice is the community bond shared by the volunteers.For the last five or six years, the same group of people have been volunteering. “Everyone enjoys each other’s company,” say Rubright. “We work hard all day, you come back eat dinner. There’s community; there’s no television, little internet, no cell services. It’s a lot what life should be like.”Like Ahl, the Rubrights have sponsored a girl there since she was eight; now she is 17. Through their support they have helped Jennifer Lopez Munoz continue to go to school and get an education.Rubright tells people, “I have three daughters in America and one in Guatemala.”“All the kids down there, they know when we come back,” says Rubright. “It’s humbling; it’s like family.” Volunteers bring with them bags of clothing and shoes for more than 200 kids.Beyond the Walls has helped other communities outside of Guatemala, such as Native Americans, homeless people in Dover and in Newark.Rubright plans to volunteer at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota next, which is known as the poorest place in the U.S., next to Haiti, from alcoholism and unemployment faced by Native Americans. “This was their country and they are at the bottom of the ladder.”Beyond the Walls is always seeking more volunteers, contributions for clothing and shoes, and financial support.Its next mission to the garbage dump is Oct. 24-31, with already 20 people signed up.Go to Beyondthewalls.org for more information.

      "St. Virgil Group Helps Keep Morris Plains Cleaner And Litter FreeAs the weather gets warmer, groups will be spreading out across Morris Plains to pick up litter and recyclables that have been carelessly tossed along roadways and in parks. The first to participate this year were a group of twelve students from St. Virgil.\n",
      "The St. Virgil group uses their mini grant money to help fund their yearly trip to Appalachia to help do work in this very depressed area. Along with two adults the young people were out on a chilly and drizzly first weekend in April to scour Simones Park. They picked up seven large bags of trash and two large bags of recyclables.\n",
      "Simones Park, at the end of Mountain Way, has been adopted by the sixth grade students from Borough School that have pledged to go out and clean the park four times a year. But Simones Park is a problem area. Even with the Borough School group, extra clean-ups, like this one by St. Virgil, and the help of neighbors that live across the street, litter is a consistent problem. Banners in the park with the litter program logo “Pick Up Morris Plains – Keep Us Litter Free” as a reminder to visitors have helped, but not enough.\n",
      "Litter is unhealthy, unsightly, and can be a safety hazard. Simones Park not only has soccer fields and open areas, but also has a well-used playground, so that broken bottles and crushed cans could lead to injuries.\n",
      "Anyone can help stop litter by using the many recycling containers and trash cans placed throughout the parks, as well as all along the main street, Speedwell Avenue. There is also a recycling container placed across the street from the train station. But even more important, the attitude that causes people to litter must be changed. People tend to think that somebody else will clean up litter left in the street or on the sidewalk, especially in places where there already is a lot of litter or places where the sense of community pride is low.\n",
      "Morris Plains wants everyone to take responsibility for their actions and pride in the environment and the town – don’t litter, put trash and recyclables in their proper place!\n",
      "Morris Plains Councilman John “Jack” Doherty is the liaison to the Clean Communities and Recycling programs and he commended the mini grant groups saying, “We are pleased that so many groups come out during the year to help with litter pickups, but hope our residents will keep our town a “community of caring” and do their part.”\n",
      "The groups that participate receive grant funds from the State Clean Communities Program. Penny Manser is head of the Youth Ministry at St. Virgil and said that, “The mission trip we take each summer is ten days of working with the people of Harlan, Kentucky, the 18th poorest county in the United States. The families there are picked by lottery for help with roofing, plumbing, painting, ditch digging, sheet rock work, siding, clean up from floods or whatever is needed by these local families. It is our opportunity to truly work as disciples in the world, and to learn to be grateful for the gifts that we have.”\n",
      "For more information about the Morris Plains Clean Communities program residents can go to the Borough of Morris Plains Web Site at https://www.morrisplainsboro.org/ and can sign up for the Mini-Grant program by contacting the Municipal Clean Communities Coordinator, Ellie Falco at (973) 538-9103.St. Virgil Group Helps Keep Morris Plains Cleaner And Litter Free  added by new_view_media on May 1, 2016View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "On Sun., Sept. 13 Macculloch Hall Historical Museum welcomes Linda J. Barth from the Canal Society of New Jersey (CSNJ) Barth will present a program about The Delaware and Raritan Canal (D&R). The D&R is one of the subjects of the current second floor gallery exhibit “Canals of New Jersey” which will be available to view prior to the presentation.Canal author and historian Linda J. Barth will introduce the people, the bridges, the locks, and the aqueducts that made D&R Canal work. This waterway, now a “greenway” and the centerpiece of a popular state park, transported men and supplies between New York and Philadelphia during three wars. Inventor John Holland used the canal to deliver his Holland VI submarine to Washington for its Navy trials, and luxury yachts, like J .P. Morgan’s Tarantula, cruised the waterway.For more than 170 years, the D&R Canal has meandered across the narrow waist of New Jersey and was one of the nation’s most successful towpath canals, carrying more tonnage in 1866 than the more famous Erie Canal. Johnson & Johnson, Roebling, and Fleischmann’s Distillery all had their start along the D&R. These days the canal provides the people of central New Jersey with both a water supply and a premier recreational facility. Today, the Morris Canal Greenway, a partnership between local communities and the Canal Society of New Jersey, seeks to preserve the surviving historic remains of the canal, interpret canal sites, and offer recreational opportunities to the public. In this presentation Linda will discuss the history and operation of the canal and how it is used today.MHHM opens at 1 p.m. on Sept. 13 and visitors who arrive prior to the 4:30 p.m. program can enjoy the “Canals of New Jersey” exhibit. MHHM has partnered with CSNJ to present this display of panels that tell the story of New Jersey’s two towpath canals, the Morris and the Delaware and Raritan. The CSNJ’s display is supplemented by objects including some from MHHM’s collection and information about Macculloch Hall founder George Macculloch who had the idea for the Morris Canal. The exhibit shares some of the stories of the workers and families who lived and worked on the canal, as well as other details about its construction using photographs and drawings, as well objects such as model canal boats.Tickets for the program go on sale from 1 p.m., no advance sales, and remain on sale until the presentation begins at 4:30 p.m. Speaker tickets include admission to the museum exhibits during the afternoon and a guided tour of period rooms, the last tour ticket is sold at 3 p.m. Speaker tickets will remain on sale until 4:30 p.m.The Museum’s second floor “The Civil War Through the Eyes of Thomas Nast” and “Canals of New Jersey” exhibits will remain on view until 4:30 p.m. The first floor “Thomas Nast: Unknown Works and American Icons” exhibit will close 3:30 p.m. – 4 p.m. in preparation for the program. Tickets to hear speakers are Adults $8; Seniors & Students $6; Children 6 – 12 $4. Members and children under 5 are admitted free.For more information call Karen Hollywood, Publicity and Programs Coordinator Macculloch Hall Historical Museum at (973) 538-2404 ext. 15.Linda Barth To Speak At MHHM added by new_view_media on August 16, 2015View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "An Evening with The Monkees\n",
      "Featuring Micky Dolenz and Peter TorkThursday, August 27 at 8 pm(Morristown) – Hey, hey it’s The Monkees, featuring Micky Dolenz and Peter Tork, coming to Mayo Performing Arts Center on Thursday, August 27, 2015 at 8 pm. Tickets are $49-99.When four young men were cast in the television roles of a struggling rock band inspired by The Beatles’ A Hard Day’s Night, few could have predicted the impact The Monkees would make on music and pop culture at large, an impact that still reverberates 50 years later.Assembled in Los Angeles in 1965 by Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider for the television series The Monkees, the quartet of Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith, Peter Tork, and the late Davy Jones brought a singular mix of pop, rock, psychedelica, Broadway, and country to their music. The show itself, meanwhile, paid tribute not only to The Beatles, but also to the comedy stylings of The Marx Brothers and Laurel and Hardy as well as the pop-art sensibilities of Warhol and the emerging San Francisco psychedelic scene.The Monkees’ first single, “Last Train to Clarksville,” was released in August 1966, hitting #1 and serving as advance publicity for their series, which debuted on September 12. When the group’s self-titled debut album arrived in stores a month later, it quickly headed for the top spot of the Billboard charts, where it would ultimately sit for 13 of the 78 weeks it remained in the Top 200. (Two decades later, in the midst of a new burst of Monkee-mania, The Monkees popped back onto the charts, bringing the total number of weeks to 102.)By the time the group’s TV series aired its final new episode on March 25, 1968, the Monkees had seen three further albums top the charts – More of the Monkees, Headquarters, and Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones, Ltd., all of which were released in 1967, staggeringly enough – while racking up several more hit singles, with “I’m a Believer,” “(I’m Not Your) Steppin’ Stone,” “A Little Bit Me, A Little Bit You,” “The Girl I Knew Somewhere,” “Pleasant Valley Sunday,” “Words,”  “Daydream Believer,” “Valleri,” and “Tapioca Tundra” all finding their way into the Billboard Top 40.After the series’ two-season run, the group went on to star in the cult feature film HEAD (co-written by Jack Nicholson) and a TV special (33 1/3 Revolutions per Monkee) while also continuing to record new material, but much as the ’60s gave way to the ’70s, the members of the Monkees eventually gave in to their individual musical interests and went their separate ways. for awhile.In February 1986, after MTV broadcast a marathon of The Monkees, Dolenz, Jones, and Tork reunited for a 20th anniversary tour, with Nesmith joining them onstage for the Los Angeles date of the tour, and in 1996, all four members of the group reunited for a new album (Justus) and TV special (Hey, Hey, It’s the Monkees).In the wake of Jones’s death on February 29, 2012, the surviving members of the Monkees reunited and performed a series of concerts. The shows were greeted with sell-out response and phenomenal reviews. Now, Micky Dolenz and Peter Tork carry on that tradition with a full evening of magic music and multi-media splendor, including clips from their Emmy Award winning series. Their new show features all of the Monkees hits, plus an intimate acoustic set and solo spots for each of the singers. An Evening With The Monkees is sure to please every fan of the band.Mayo Performing Arts Center, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, presents a wide range of programs that entertain, enrich, and educate the diverse population of the region and enhance the economic vitality of Northern New Jersey. The 2015-2016 season is made possible, in part, by a grant the New Jersey State Council on the Arts/Department of State, a Partner Agency of the National Endowment for the Arts, as well as support received from the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation, F.M. Kirby Foundation and numerous corporations, foundations and individuals.

      "Unveiled earlier this year after several years of planning, the Center for Nursing Innovation and Research (CNIR) for Morristown Medical Center (MMC) is providing greater research and innovation.\n",
      "MMC holds the American Nurses Credentialing Center’s (ANCC) designation of a “magnet facility;” inspired by the ANCC requirement for its “magnet recognition program,” a formal plan to expand innovation and research resources via a specialized nursing center evolved. With support from the Women’s Association for MMC, the organizers were able to realize their vision this year.\n",
      "“We are grateful to the Women’s Association for MMC for the funding to support the CNIR,” said Carol Jones, chief nursing officer of MMC. “Within ten months of receiving funding the new space was built and utilized.”\n",
      "According to Jones, the primary goal of CNIR will be “improving patient and family outcomes related to the health and well-being of individuals.” This design will be accomplished by utilizing CNIR’s research capacity to find improvements in healthcare, researching best practices or by exploring innovative changes in care delivery. PhD-prepped nurses will be spearheading all research and innovative\n",
      "endeavors at the center.\n",
      "According to Jones, one benefit of the CNIR is more flexible scheduling. For example, two formal education programs for research and innovation are held annually at MMC; the classes now take place at the CNIR, facilitating participation.\n",
      "Additionally, the CNIR will hold classes highlighting new perspectives leading to innovations in the fall. An Evidence-based Scholar Program is also now held at the center.\n",
      "Jones pointed out the various ways that the CNIR will serve the diverse needs of nurses.\n",
      "“Frequently, there is a research component associated with academic studies,” said Jones. Nurses who are required to conduct research for academic purposes [can do so at CNIR], and seek guidance from nurse researchers at the center. Other nurses seek to learn about the evaluation of existing evidence or how to generate new\n",
      "knowledge through research.”\n",
      "The CNIR is open to any nurse working at Morristown Medical Center, and no special requirements are needed to meet with the nurse researchers about new ideas or research projects.\n",
      "“Motivated nurses are welcome and encouraged to utilize the resources and space!” Jones stated, adding that the formal classes on Evidence-based Practice and Innovation require an application due to limited class size.\n",
      "According to Jones, in the short period of time since the CNIR’s opening, nurses and physicians have provided favorable feedback. The frequent use of the space, including use by interprofessional teams for concept exploration and assistance planning studies has demonstrated the need for and desirability of the center.\n",
      "Additionally, members of the non-medical community who have seen the CNIR have shared their enthusiasm for nursing activities with Jones and her colleagues.\n",
      "Expressing hope that use of the center will continue to evolve and grow, Jones stated that nursing leadership at MMC will perhaps engage members of the community and area organizations, such as the Women’s Association for Morristown Medical Center, to collaborate on efforts of how to best serve the community.\n",
      "“Serving the community, as well as improving patient outcomes, are goals of the Atlantic Health System and Morristown Medical Center,” Jones said. “Nurse leaders at Morristown Medical Center have always been innovators!”New Medical Center Aims To Encourage Nursing Innovation added by new_view_media on August 22, 2018View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Congratulations! The college process is over! The applying, the application fees, the running around for recommendation letters. It’s all over. Now the whole family is probably running to the nearest Bed Bath and Beyond trying to find which comforter is the most “aesthetically pleasing” to the ideal dream college dorm. Before running for those necessities, come back to reality and realize that this isn’t the end of the worry.\n",
      "For most families, how much money college will cost is top priority because as years continue, the prices for schools climb. Have no fear, here are some ways for soon to be college students to save and make money to help them keep college costs as low as possible.\n",
      "Apply for federal work study Federal Work Study is a program most schools have in which students receive a job through the student employment office.

      "Federal work study is also a great way for students to get involved with their school as well as making money.\n",
      "Apply for EOF\n",
      "EOF (Educational Opportunity Fund), is a scholarship that allows New Jersey students to receive a well-rounded education that they normally would not be able to afford. Given to those students more than capable of doing great things after college, chosen applicants are given full admission to the university that they attend, financial support, and services throughout the year to help them succeed during their next four years.\n",

      "“Today’s Care, Tomorrow’s cure:” This is the inspiring mission of the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation.\n",
      "On July 1, the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation in Short Hills received a three year, 6.5 million dollar federal grant to help people who are living with spinal cord injuries and other conditions that cause paralysis. Some of these conditions include spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, (ALS), stroke, spina bifida and cerebral palsy. This money will aid these people in\n",
      "the many battles and challenges they face on a daily basis, enhancing their lives.\n",
      "The foundation is the recipient of the National Paralysis Resource Center cooperative agreement from the Administration for Community Living.   The Reeve Foundation has operated the Paralysis Resource Center (PRC) for approximately 16 years.\n",
      "Quality of life: Everyone strives to obtain it, the enjoyment and independence that make life worth living. So many people take it for granted.  But having quality of life is often difficult, if not nearly impossible, when people have physical disabilities impeding their way.\n",
      "But those from the Short Hills based Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation seek to change that. Their belief is simple: That every human being should be able to obtain and lead full and rich lives, regardless of their physical condition. They have an unwavering conviction that every human being deserves a life filled with\n",
      "dignity.\n",
      "Both Christopher and Dana Reeve were staunch advocates and champions for the disabled.

      "staunchly sought to give them hope, because he knew how easily they could feel hopeless.\n",
      "A staggering 1 in 50 people in the United States, approximately 5.4 million Americans live with paralysis of some kind. And those aren’t just numbers or statistics; they are people close to us. “We all know someone a brother, sister, friend, neighbor or colleague who is suffering with paralysis. They aren’t strangers. They are one degree of separation from all of us,” officials assert.\n",
      "The Reeves’ Foundation is dedicated to performing innovative research, securing grants, providing information and much needed advocacy to aid their clients.\n",
      "During the past 16 years and moving forward, The Reeve Foundation and National Paralysis Resource Center continue to compete in a rigorous bidding process for every three years’ worth of funding, but the results for their clients are golden.\n",
      "Since it opened in 2002, 100,000 people have been aided by this organization with approximately 20,000 people helped in the past three years alone.\n",
      "According to Anna Chamberlain, supervisor of Marketing and Communications for the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation since 2015, the Reeve Foundation has a dual mission.\n",
      "“We focus on creating resources and programs to help the 5.4 million Americans and their families impacted by paralysis though our Paralysis Resource Center while also funding innovative and cutting edge research to find cures for spinal cord injuries in the near future,” she explains.\n",
      "Offering a multitude of free services such as their peer program which offers a way of connecting individuals and caregivers with respective peer mentors to offer much needed emotional support, their military veterans program, information specialists, quality of life grants, program advocacy, and policy programs, these resources are designed to aid the whole individual.  They empower both the body and spirit, to help to navigate the insecure journey ahead.\n",
      "“The programs help individuals return to actively participating in their communities, achieving independence and self-sufficiency, achieving things we take for granted like learning how to drive again, going back to work and even leaving their own homes are also ways in which the PRC helps individuals every day.” Chamberlain enthuses.\n",
      "This recent grant will do so much for so many, making positive and uplifting differences in their lives.\n",
      "“We are thrilled that we can continue to expand our programs to help even more individuals and families create a pathway to navigate their way towards an independent and thriving future,” Chamberlain says.  “In many ways the PRC provides hope that many have lost, especially after those few days and weeks after a traumatic injury or event. I am personally thrilled we were evaluated on our demonstrated impact, value and positive outcomes. The PRC has helped so many families; it acts as a lifeline when their lives have changed in an instant. The grant will keep that lifeline open for those who need it the most.”\n",
      "Chamberlain sums up the mission of the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation perfectly: “We not only are giving helpful tools (to clients), we are giving hope.”\n",

      "By Elsie WalkerThirty-five years ago, Terry Cook Delahaya USA in Chester started a car show that turned into an event like no other: Lead East, known as the world’s biggest ‘50’s party. The event grew to become a journey back in time to the music, dance, movies, and sights of the 1950s.\n",
      "After the last Lead East, Cook decided to retire to write a book. However, the party isn’t over. Four longtime Lead East attendees from the Hope area have taken ownership of the event and Jim Craig of Great Meadows has become event coordinator. With these changes, Lead East still features an abundance of classic cars, but it is morphing from a party into a festival of the 1950s, with more offerings for kids than in the past. Classic cars are still a big part of it, as is the spirit of giving. Lead East will run from Thursday, Aug. 30 to Sunday, Sept. 2 at the Parsippany Hilton.\n",
      "“We want to open the door to more generations and introduce other generations to the ‘50’s,” explained Craig. He compares attending Lead East to being beamed up to a spaceship and taken back in time. Things were different then. “In the ‘50s, everything was American; it was an American phenomenon,” he said.\n",
      "Lead East has always had the sounds of rock and roll bands and accapella do-wop groups, the look of ‘50s fashion like poodle skirts and greased back hair, plus a traditional prom and even Elvis sightings. Now, it is offering more for not only those who remember the ‘50s, but those experiencing it for the first time.\n",
      "Craig shared that people can learn about how to dress like the ‘50’s or to decorate their home ‘50’’s style. Country line dancing has been added to the dance lesson offerings. Craig noted that classic country was also part of the ‘50’s. For kids there will be Craigles the clown, a clown mobile, a flea circus, face painting, balloon animals and contests.  A model making contest will be open to both boys and girls, in two different age groups. The children will be supplied with model car kits and judged on who does best at putting one together. Another contest for kids is to see who can get the best greaser (greaser down hair) look.\n",
      "Of course, Lead East wouldn’t be Lead East without cars with 1,400 plus cars expected to arrive by Friday of the event. They come from not only New Jersey, but a variety of states. Also, they’re not all from the ‘50s. There will be cars from the 1930s – 1970s: classics, rot rods, muscle cars and more.\n",
      "One aspect of Lead East is that of giving. Every year, Lead East picks a charity to support and this year it is the Ashley-Lauren Foundation which helps children in N.J. who have cancer. There will be a booth at which 50/50 tickets will be sold.\n",
      "Also, as it has been for many years, Piccatinny Arsenal, from Dover, will be on hand showing some of its military vehicles and collecting toys for Toys for Tots to be given out to needy area children at Christmas. The Parsippany police and fire departments are also expected to be on hand with vehicles and taking donations.\n",

      "With teen suicide on the rise throughout the state, Senator Richard Codey (D-Livingston), recently unveiled a $1 million plan to combat depression and help educate people on mental health.\n",
      "On July 1, the former governor introduced a bill that will award a $1 million grant within the NJ Department of Education (DOE) for school districts to hire mental health counselors.\n",
      "The NJ Department of Health will determine which school districts are awarded grants. The DOE will report on progress by 2021. There will be specialized training workshops to non-licensed, auxiliary school staff who interact with students and a creation of a statewide “Teen Suicide and Depression Task Force” charged with developing additional methods to combat teen suicide and depression and report back to the state legislature by July 2019.\n",
      "“School workers such as secretaries, security guards and teacher’s aides need the tools and training to recognize bullying, early warning signs and symptoms of mental health issues, and the proper steps to resolve conflict and prevent potential disasters,” declared Governor Codey at a press conference at Liberty Middle School in West Orange in May.\n",
      "According to the New Jersey Youth Suicide Report, 2,731 people age 10 to 24 were treated in an emergency room for non-fatal suicide attempts/self-inflicted injuries from 2013 to 2015. Also, according to the New Jersey Dept. of Health, from 2007 to 2016, suicides among children ages 10 to 18 rose by 16.6 percent.\n",
      "“Too many young lives are being lost,” Codey said at the press conference. “New Jersey must act now to better equip all school employees to help identify at-risk students and prevent teen suicides and other mental health related incidents in their schools.”\n",
      "Codey and his wife, Mary Jo Codey, have been involved with mental health since 2012 when they established the Codey Fund for Mental Health. The organization’s goal is to educate people about mental health and provide quality treatment for individuals with mental illness.\n",
      "Mary Jo has dealt with depression and Codey has met with many parents who have lost kids to suicide, including Dianne Grossman of Rockaway, whose daughter Mallory took her own life at age 12 in June 2017 and Rachelle St. Phard, whose son Coby committed suicide in March 2016 at age 18.\n",
      "The governor has been surrounded by death most of his life. He is the owner of Codey and Jones Funeral Home in Caldwell, but noted that he has never seen so saw many young people die until recently.\n",
      "Codey feels that social media is a huge factor in teen depression and suicide. Instead of being outside with friends or being active, bullying follows kids home onto Snapchat, Twitter or Facebook, making their lives even worse, he said.\n",
      "With the recent suicides of designer Kate Spade and renowned chef, Anthony Bourdain, depression can affect anyone, he said. The governor hopes these deaths may get people to talk about depression.“The biggest thing for mental health is to overcome the stigma of depression,” he said. “Teenage suicide is not a comfortable issue for people to talk about.”Governor Cody Aims To Prevent Teen Suicide added by new_view_media on July 18, 2018View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "Many in the Morristown community and beyond knew Myles Mislavsky (Morristown High School – Class of 2013). His smile was contagious and his friendliness was well-known. To honor his life, his family – Hector Mislavsky, Judy Martinez and Jessie Mislavsky – has created a college-debt forgiveness fund – the Myles Smiled on You Award – for Morristown High School alumni to be administered by the Morris Educational Foundation. The award, for secondary education loan reduction, will be given to deserving MHS alumni who exemplify Myles’ many positive characteristics. It was created to reduce the burden of debt many students carry after college making it hard for them to save and get ahead. The award is funded by family, friends and the Golden Bagel Runners who knew and loved Myles. Myles was an amazing human being. Witty, charismatic, giving and loyal…these words merely scratch the surface in describing Myles. He made a lasting impact on the lives of those around him and was committed to helping others. He radiated joy with a smile so infectious that even on your worst days, he lifted your spirit. People were drawn to Myles and were better having known him. The award application is open to all Morristown High School alumni – Class of 2009 and after – who have graduated from a college, university or trade school (2 or 4 year) and have student loans. In 2019, this scholarship will be awarded to multiple alumni who graduated after 2009, at least one of whom graduated with Myles in 2013. In addition to demonstrating college debt burden, the award application requires 3 – 250 word or less essays: how have you dealt with challenging situations (mental or physical health, or other) and how did you or are you dealing with those challenges; describe how you have demonstrated empathy toward others; and what do you do to help your family/community, as well as a letter of recommendation. “We are honored to administer the Myles Smiled On You Award on behalf of the Mislavsky/Martinez family. We are so grateful to our donors, like the Mislavskys/Martinez Family, whose generosity inspires and impacts our Morristown High School community,” said Patty Haralampoudis, the Chair of the Morris Educational Foundation. It is the hope of the Mislavsky/Martinez Family that with this financial award, Myles will “smile on” Morristown High School alumni just as he did during his amazing life. Morris Educational Foundation Announces Myles Smiled on You Award for College-Debt Forgiveness Created in honor of Myles Mislavsky  added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "By Dawn M Chiossi  Morristown High School Graduate Amelia Langan has certainly been busy. Thanks to her recent activities in raising awareness about organ and tissue donation, she founded a Donate Life club at her school and was one of six students awarded a scholarship for the 2019-2020 academic year from the New Jersey Sharing Network.   The New Jersey Sharing Network is committed to saving and enhancing lives through organ donation. Giving a second chance at life, organ and tissue donation does just that. Just making that one decision can save lives, and make a huge, enriching impact on the lives of others.   As Langan discovered, it can also do the same thing for the self.   Like most people, Langan became aware of the importance of organ donation only when she took her driver’s education class in school. In hearing speaker– and liver transplant recipient–Michele Dabal, she became aware of how organ donation can impact and benefit others.  “She cleared up a lot of misconceptions and concerns that people have regarding organ donation,” Langan explains. “Hearing her story on how organ donation helped her to survive really resonated with me,” Langan shares.  Langan was so inspired by Dabal, she began to do her own research regarding organ donation, about how many lives could be changed for the better. It soon became a cause she became passionate about.   “One person can save up to eight lives with organ donation, and up to fifty with tissue donation,” she enthuses.  Langan was awarded the scholarship for diligently volunteering with the New Jersey Sharing Network, devoting an impressive 80 hours to volunteering.  Additionally, she raised awareness regarding organ and tissue donation for her Girl Scout Gold Award project.    Wanting to inspire others regarding organ donation, Langan founded a Donate Life club at her high school. The club came into existence during her junior year of 2017.    Describing Morristown’s Donate Life club as a small one of approximately 20-25 members, they do so much. Members volunteer with the New Jersey Sharing Network. Additionally, the club lined up speakers for people to hear inspiring stories regarding their organ and tissue donations.  For Langan, the goal was to get people talking about organ donation and to start a conversation about it. The club did this in a variety of ways.   “This is such an easy way to make a positive impact in our country. Organ donation affects everyone everywhere (even globally). It is so widespread,” she asserts. Through her passion and research, Langan and the club discovered that in Morristown alone, approximately 21 people were on the list looking for a transplant. “Everyone knows someone affected.”  Although Langan is a Freshman at Boston’s Northeastern University and is already fully committed to majoring in behavioral neuroscience and minoring in biochemistry to go into the field of research for cancer, she still is helping in the cause close to her heart. She has extended the parameters of the club, creating a video explaining and inspiring other high school students how they can help in the cause of organ donation and create a Donate Life club of their own.  Langan’s excitement to inspire others to make a difference through organ and tissue donation has even extended to her sister and her sister’s best friend. Both are going to take up the mantle of Morristown’s Donate Life club, to put their own ideas to it.   For Langan, everything is connected and stems from the information and inspiration she received from Driver’s Ed class. “I was so surprised to receive the scholarship,” she shares. “I didn’t think I had a chance of winning. It was Michele who persuaded me to apply. If I hadn’t met her, I wouldn’t have been inspired to do any of this. It wasn’t just me, (being awarded the scholarship or success of the club) so many people were a beacon of encouragement. From Michele, to Brooke, and Daniel Sarnowski at New Jersey Sharing Network, to so many others behind the scenes. I’m very grateful.”Changing the World, Raising Awareness About Organ and Tissue Donation, Morristown Grad Founds Donate Life Club, Wins Scholarship added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "By: Jason Cohen Swimming runs in the blood of Jack Alexy. All of his siblings are swimmers, but he will be the first to have the chance to be in the Olympics. In June 2020, the Mendham resident will be competing against 1500 people in the Olympic Trials for swimming in Omaha, Neb. “I’m not going to know how it feels until I’m there,” Alexy said. “I know I’m definitely going to be nervous.” Alexy, 16, is a junior at Delbarton School in Morristown and has been swimming for the Somerset Hills YMCA Swim team in Basking Ridge since he was 8. After watching his older siblings Kate, 20, and Max, 18, swim; he quickly fell in love with the sport and followed in their footsteps. While his parents Lynn and Matt were not swimmers, they felt it was important for their children to learn. Their younger brother, Rob, 15, also swims.“My parents just wanted all of their kids to know how to swim for safety,” Alexy explained. Alexy said Kate and Max had a big influence on him. Swimming brought them closer and they taught him to never give up and always stay calm. In fact, Kate swims at Kenyon College in Ohio and Alexy hopes to swim in college as well. Alexy also played basketball, but quit in eighth grade to focus on swimming.He started to realize he had a future in swimming three years ago when he made the YMCA Nationals team. After that, he made nationals the next three years.Today swimming is a huge part of his life. He practices six days a week for two hours a day and has a few dry practices as well. In fact, he met some of his best friends from swimming.“That’s one of the best things about swimming, the people and the bonds,” he commented. In 2016 Lori Riegler took over as his coach. Over the past few years they have gotten close and she has helped him become a better swimmer. Alexy knows he has a long road ahead as he prepares for the Olympic Trials. He qualified for the 50 and 100 meter freestyle and in order to make the Olympics has to finish top two in an event. Right now he trains by swimming 25 yards, but in the trials it is 50 meters. So, in February, he will change his to 50. “It’s pretty crazy,” he said. “I still got a lot of work to do before then.”In August, he had a bit of a preview of what it will be like at the trials when he participated in the World Junior Championships in Budapest, Hungary. It was his first intentional competition. “It’s (Olympic Trials) definitely special,’ he said. “I got a little taste of that over the summer in Budapest.” Mendham Resident to Compete in Olympic Trials for Swimming  added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "By: Elise Phillips Margulis  Mendham-based artist Jeff Gould, known for his stunning fine art landscapes and abstract Surrealistic compositions, is having an  exhibition called “Views from Schiff” which will feature paintings directly from and inspired by Schiff Nature Preserve in Mendham.  Gould will be showing his “nature and animal surreal mashups” as well. The exhibit will also include Japanese-inspired artwork by artist Al Gunther www.dragonflystudios-algunther.com.” The “Views from Schiff” exhibit will be on October 5th from 4:00 to 6:00 p.m. at the Alhamra Gallery and Art Center in Bernardsville. Blues legend Barry Blues will play a music set and refreshments will be served. The entertainment and food are free. Some of the proceeds will go to Schiff Nature Preserve. Gould hails from New Rochelle, NY. He recalls being “artistic at a very early age and copying cartoons out of the newspaper, including Charlie Brown for a piece of promotional material for my kindergarten class.” He drew “Mad Magazine” characters when he was a bit older. Gould also enjoyed drawing superheroes. Some of his favorite artists and inspirations are Mort Drucker and Don Martin. Gould’s biggest childhood artist influence was Norman Rockwell. “I used to sit down for hours with pencil and paper trying to copy his paintings,” shared Gould.  “Oddly, we seem to occupy the same towns. From growing up in New Rochelle where he lived, to spending summers in the Berkshires where his main studio was.” Gould added, “And now I live in the Schiff on Rockwell Court which was named after him because he had a studio here and painted some of the early covers of the Boy Scout manuals!” After Gould graduated from University of the Arts in Philadelphia, he designed toys for a company in New York. Then he designed packaging for the pharmaceutical industry. His next position was Art Director and then Marketing Director in the Midwest. Gould’s wife, Karen, is from northwest Indiana on the Chicago side. After they were married they lived in different areas of the United States and in Canada. When Karen accepted a job at AT&T in 2001, they “fell in love with this area.”  Gould decided to become a stay-at-home dad and work as a freelancer doing illustration, graphic design and portraits when his children were born.  “I always loved the masters like Da Vinci and Rubens. Rockwell and Maxfield Parish were also some of my favorites. I also loved the French impressionists and nature and started doing oils, mainly for fun.” He was able to achieve his dream of having his work hang in homes and galleries as his children got older. Once they were more self-sufficient he immersed himself into painting his own masterpieces. Living in the Brookrace subdivision of Schiff enables him to explore the gorgeous nature preserve daily. “I walk my dog on the many trails every day of the year. I am never at a loss for the beauty that nature provides.”  In addition to enjoying Schiff, Gould noted, “My wife and I love hiking and scuba diving and nature in general. And trying to communicate that beauty with a paintbrush is my passion.” Gould won the Award of Excellence from The Center for Contemporary Art in Bernardsville for his “Schiff Meadow #2” painting over the summer.  Gould invites you to attend his October 5th Gallery Exhibit to enjoy his vibrant surrealistic painting, blues music and delicious food. A portion of the proceeds will be donated to the Schiff. The Alhamra Gallery & Art Center is located at 21 Clairmont Rd, Bernardsville. Mendham Artist Will Exhibit Paintings at Alhamra Gallery & Art Center in Bernardsville on October 5 added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "By: Michele DiPasquale To some, a library may be a thing of the past; but in fact, libraries are currently visited much more frequently than one might think. And public libraries can still proclaim that they are not only crucial to the populace for offering the enjoyment of reading for free, but for the very relevant and contemporary services they provide. In fact, a recent survey showed that, since 2016, 53% of Millennials say they used a library at least twice in any given year, and that number is actually higher when comparing it to 45% of Gen Xers and 43% of Baby Boomers who were simultaneously polled. So even in today’s online world, the public library is still absolutely in demand. Catherine Tinger GoldbergThere are public libraries for children, adolescents, teens, and adults, but the very first library for your very young child, is, in fact, First Library® of Morristown. At First Library new mothers and parents can borrow books and other materials, make use of reference collections, enjoy computer services, and encourage early literacy and the joy of reading.  “The idea to start First Library® came to me after my friend, Diane, had her first child. I wanted to give my love of reading to her and her newborn, so I sent her some books to read to her baby son, Lubin. Diane later explained that she was having a hard time finding English-language children’s books to read to him and that my books were the perfect gift for a new first-time mother (from the United States living in France). So I began sending her a new children’s book every month – many were childhood favorites of my own children. Diane would call or write to say how she, and later her son, happily anticipated the arrival of their monthly book and the joy they received reading it together, and how they both looked forward to reading time,” shared Catherine Tinger Goldberg, founder and director of First Library®. She felt that if a book could bring so much happiness, joy, and comfort to just one child, how much could it bring to multiple children? It was then that she decided to create First Library®. By taking a cue from Dolly Parton and her Imagination Library program, Ms. Tinger Goldberg followed Ms. Parton’s idea. The Imagination Library was created in 1995 for in-need children in Ms. Parton’s native Tennessee. The purpose was and is for each child, regardless of gender, race, or income, to register at the Imagination Library program and receive a free book each month until the age of five, paid for by Ms. Parton’s Dollywood Foundation®. While it began for children in need in Tennessee, Ms. Parton, by the year 2000, allowed and promoted the replication of the program to other states.  In order to promote local library patronage, First Library® became more than a free monthly book program. Ms. Tinger Goldberg devised a curriculum for first-time mothers in need that was tailored to their and their firstborn child’s special circumstances. The curriculum would give first-time parents in need the First Library® book program (or other books) and gently-used clothing and educational toys during their child’s first three years of life, free of charge, by requiring parents to read to their child daily and submit a reading log each month.  First Library promotes regular local library patronage and does not operate its own private, first-time mothers only, library facility.\n",
      " All requested library activities are to be performed at the first time mother’s home library. Also, although the three programs, First Library, More First Library and Most First Library are similar but differentiate themselves in the amount of activities required, all of the items we offer for selection by the mothers, except for the previously chosen new Imagination Library books, are brand new, not gently used. “All we ask is that parents read to their child daily and maintain regular library patronage,” Ms. Tinger Goldberg explained.  “Essentially we are a free book program but sometimes more than a book a month is necessary to bring the importance of regular reading and books into a home. For children born under the poverty level there are new educational toys and clothing available for the parents,” Ms. Tinger Goldberg said. “I feel it is so important for children to be read to early and consistently. Children should have a firm foundation for a lifetime love of reading, respect for literature, and an appreciation for all things the library has to offer. I hope I am achieving these goals with First Library®,” Ms. Tinger Goldberg explained. Because First Library is in five counties and growing throughout the State of New Jersey, aside from receptions at their offices, they rely on individual community members and Community Actions teams to spread the word about First Library’s mission and fundraising efforts. They do accept monetary donations on behalf of the donor’s community through Classy.org. First Library is also an approved charity of the AmazonSmile program. “What parents and other community members are starting to realize is that if we help all children, whether they are less fortunate or not, learn to read early and on a consistent basis, we are helping everyone in their class, school, and community,” she shared. First Library is available in Livingston, Carteret, Edison, North Brunswick, Port Reading, Sewaren, Perrineville, Cedar Knolls, Chatham Borough, Chatham Township, Green Village, Morristown, New Vernon, Whippany, Somerset, and Basking Ridge.  First Library Will Help Build Libraries of Babies added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "By Dawn M Chiossi  Going on since February of this year, Hackettstown’s Heath Village inspires their staff with its English Language Program.   This program is a class format, an offshoot of the Adult English Language Tutoring Program sponsored by the Literacy New Jersey Sussex Branch. This program is for any adult in Sussex or Warren Counties, who would like to improve their facility with English– making them more comfortable speaking English.    It has been said that education is a great equalizer. It opens doors to everyone; it stirs curiosity, accesses information, and lets the mind ponder, inquire and enjoy.   The English Language Program is spearheaded and run by two-year Heath Village resident, Marguerite Gadel, as well as Susan Sumner. Gadel explains that the program works with the State and Local Literacy New Jersey Organization’s Sussex Branch (a branch that expands to Warren County.)  Gadel herself had been a part of the literacy organization for an impressive 20 years.   Although relatively new, Heath Village’s program is an informal, inclusive one. It focuses mainly on spoken communication, conversational English, and some grammar and spelling.  Concentrating on how to be comfortable speaking English, students will learn enough to communicate easily in functional areas such as making appointments or filling out forms. The program seeks to make communications easier and much more fluid, both in work and social situations.   Additionally, the class will make it more enjoyable for students to follow a TV program or read a book. “I want them to really enjoy reading in English,” Gadel shares.   “There’s even some students in the class who are taking their test for citizenship. That’s a big job,” she prides.  Gadel explains that she came up with the idea of starting the program soon after she moved to Heath Village.   Immediately proposing the idea to Heath Village’s CEO to make the program available, and receiving an overwhelmingly positive response, she set to work.   Wanting the English Language Program to be engaging and relatable for the students, the program involves them right away by having them read out loud. “We try to jump on something of interest to the students or go over something from the week before that they had learned,” Gadel explains.    For these students, learning English is not a chore, but a pleasure.  Gadel can’t say enough about her students in general, admiring their determination and hard work ethic. “They come to class completely on their own time. Usually after working a full day. Then they’ll have to go home, take care of their families and do homework. It’s so impressive that they are willing to put in the time and effort to do this,” she enthuses.  They will even find creative ways to learn. For example, Gadel relates that one of her students will watch the news without subtitles to learn what is going on.  For Gadel, just the small act of using her talents to make a difference in the lives of others has created a ripple effect. “I love seeing the students help each other,” she says. “For instance, a student from Mexico will help someone from Colombia. It is wonderful to see that happen. It is thrilling to see them put in so much effort and work so hard to learn.”  Gadel sees with her own eyes how much of an impact the program is making to her students. They are not only learning but enjoying. What’s more, they are sharing that feeling and connection with others.  “I remember when the class discovered that Heath Village had a new resident, a lady from England who had been in England’s Royal Air Force (R.A.F.) in World War II,” Gadel shares. “A student had recently read an article to us regarding the R.A.F. Because of that, the class eagerly wanted to talk to this lady and ask her questions. They were so involved, asking about her experiences and how they were different in England as opposed to here in America. It was wonderful.”  The Literacy New Jersey Sussex Branch will be training new volunteers to be tutors beginning in late September.  Training for new tutors is offered in the spring and the fall. It is ideal for someone who would like to make a difference, no experience is necessary.  Training consists of three in-person meetings interspersed with online training. The first session is especially useful in helping people decide whether or not they would like to do the tutoring. “I would love to encourage some people to train for this great volunteer work. We always have waiting students,” Gadel enthuses. For further information or details on tutoring, please contact Literacy New Jersey Sussex County Office at 973-300-9444 or by visiting www.literacynj.orgHackettstown’s Heath Village Inspires Staff with English Language Program added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "(BPT) – Snacks, produce, drinks or sweets – if it is a seasonal offering, Americans are anxiously awaiting it. According to Nielsen, Americans spend about $374 billion annually on snack foods. For many of those snack lovers, items that are only available for a limited time are one of the major highlights of seasonal occasions and holidays, especially this time of year when, according to a recent Cheetos brand survey, 65 percent of Americans profess their love of seasonal Easter treats.Whether your favorite holiday arrives in spring, summer, winter or fall, seasonal treats can sweeten your enjoyment of the season. No one wants to miss the coveted special flavors and offerings that appear on store shelves for short stints and are quickly cleared out by that clever “seasonal snack stockpiler” who is always one step ahead of you. So here’s your guide to the top treats to watch for this spring, and throughout the year.SpringIt might still be too chilly to feel like spring in some areas of the country, but St. Patrick’s Day undoubtedly marks the start of the springtime snacking season. Milkshake lovers will kick things off with mint-green milkshakes, and quickly turn their attention to Easter candies and snacks.Chocolate and marshmallow sweets are the traditional stars of Easter baskets across the country – for both the young, and the young at heart. It is no surprise that 71 percent of parents who celebrate Easter admit to sneaking snacks from their kids’ baskets, according to the Cheetos survey.Of course, everyone is familiar with jelly beans, peanut butter eggs, chocolate bunnies and marshmallow chicks, but the majority of consumers say they desire more variety beyond just candy. This year, there’s a new must-try alternative to satisfy the search for something beyond the candy animal monotony. Cheetos Sweetos, the cinnamon-sugar version of everyone’s favorite cheddar cheese snacks is reappearing in stores — and Easter baskets — this spring, but only for a limited time. Launched in 2015, Sweetos snacks are the perfect, and delicious, twist on Easter snacking.SummerFrozen treats are the highlight of summer, but not just the ice cream quarts you find year-round in the freezer cases at your local grocer. Summer means the ice cream truck will be rolling through neighborhood streets, sounding that familiar melodic “come and get it” tune and serving up frozen favorites that you just can’t find anywhere else —  or at any other time of year.You can’t go wrong with the missile-shaped, multi-colored ice pops that beckon from beside a myriad of fruit-flavored cream pops, or reliable favorites like ice cream sandwiches and chocolate-topped cones. And don’t forget snow cones — the refreshing shaved ice in perfect spheres mounted on a paper funnel and topped with your favorite sweet flavoring!FallOf course everyone knows fall is pumpkin season — and you should take every chance to enjoy all things pumpkin-flavored this time of year, from coffee and ice cream to bread, cake and pie.However, autumn also heralds state fair season across the country — and the arrival of a variety of innovative sweet treats that can only be enjoyed among the unique surroundings of fair rides, tickets and games. Funnel cakes are a state fair staple, and what could be better when the weather gets nippy than enjoying lightly sweetened, deep-fried dough dusted heavily with confectioner’s sugar? Depending on where you live in the country and which fair you attend, you can find over-the-top sweets and snacks such as deep-fried ice cream, fried candy bars and even pretzel-encrusted brownies deep-fried on a stick.WinterOf course, winter holidays are the pinnacle of seasonal snacking. From the final weeks of pumpkin season to the eggnog, candy canes and baked goods associated with holiday moments from Thanksgiving through New Year’s, winter serves up a buffet of food and snacks that are available at no other time of year.Winter’s arrival means anticipated delicacies like gingerbread-flavored everything, bite-sized candy favorites that marry mint and chocolate in holiday shapes, and of course the much-maligned and equally beloved fruit cake all hit store shelves just in time to make the holiday party circuit!Whatever your preference — savory, salty or sweet — make sure to enjoy these snacking staples throughout the year. But remember that seasonal treats come and go quickly, so be ready to grab a bag of Sweetos snacks, remember to listen for the ice cream truck’s playful tune, try your state’s delicacies and fill stockings with enough gingerbread cookies or mint-themed chocolate drops to last through the end of the year!Don’t miss these must-have snacks that define each season of the year added by new_view_media on April 3, 2016View all posts by new_view_media →\n",

      "by Elsie Walker Halloween will soon be here.  Many times on Halloween, or around camp fires, stories of ghosts; strange, creepy or haunted places; and recollections of strange occurrences are shared.  Some people pass stories on from generation to generation until they become legend. However, others, like members of the New Jersey Ghost Hunters Society (NJGHS), investigate strange occurrences to see if there is a paranormal presence involved.  Recently, people from around the coverage area shared stories and sightings of local ghosts, rumors of haunted locations, and experiences with the paranormal. Members of the online, “You Know You’re From Roxbury Township….” group recalled ghost tales and scary sights.  One popular ghost story was the Hooker Man. It is about a ghost seen by the Succasunna railroad tracks. “The Hooker Man lost his hand in some freak train accident, and now searches for it with a lantern,” shared Mike Stark, Roxbury.   However, it appears the Hooker Man has not only been seen in Roxbury, but Netcong, Flanders, Chester, and Long Valley also lay claim to the legend. Cheryl McClung, a former area resident, who now lives in Georgia, shared, “At night, people see his [the Hooker Man’s] lantern bouncing along the tracks in Flanders on the west side of [Route} 206. Dawn Traetta Hair, of Florida, another former Roxbury resident, remembers the stories of the former location of the Church of the Mystic Light in Flanders.  The building is closed, but there had been claims that witches had hung chickens and have had seances there. People still stop by it, out of curiosity, if not scared away.Kim Howell Candore shared that there have been ghost sightings at her childhood home, “I was raised at 11 Meeker Street [in] Succasunna, next to the cemetery. There has been many spottings of two men in Civil War uniforms smoking, sitting on a tree stump in front of our old house,”   said Candore, who now lives in Tennessee. Candore remembers that the two churches on Main Street, adjacent to the cemetery, used to be a military hospital. Also shared, was that Roxbury has its very own “haunted house” in the form of the Halloween House, a tremendous display put on by the Heard family in Roxbury.Hackettstown is the meeting site of the NJ Ghost Hunters Society.  The society’s mission statement is “To search out definitive proof of life beyond the grave.  To provide paranormal investigations to those who request them, free of charge. To train those individuals, who so desire and become members of the NJGHS, in the protocols of professional, ethical and scientific paranormal investigating..” L’aura  Hladik Hoffman is the society’s founder and director. She is the author of Ghosthunting New Jersey, Ghosthunting New York City, and Ghosts of the Poconos and has a variety of presentations on the paranormal which will be given at area libraries this month  (listed on the bottom of www.njghs.net/presentations.html). Recently, Hoffman recalled stories she was told of two ghosts who are said to haunt Bea McNally’s (formerly Charlie Brown Restaurant).  In 1878, the place was the Clarendon House (hotel) and from 1926-1947 it was the Hackettstown Inn.  “The ghost girl appeared to a young girl who was living at the hotel when her family owned it. She snuck down to the kitchen in the middle of the night for some ice cream. When she was headed out of the kitchen and into the dining room to sneak back upstairs, she was met with this bright, sparkling light and out of the light stepped a young girl – about the same age of the girl sneaking the ice cream – and the ghost girl was dressed from a different time period and clutching her teddy bear. The ice cream girl screamed, dropped the ice cream and ran up to her room. The next day when her parents confronted her about the mess in the dining room, they did not believe her about the ghost girl she saw. However, a couple weeks later, the father saw the ghost girl, too.”As for the other ghost, Hoffman said there are various origin stories as to who he is. Most have to do with drowning. Two versions have him as a child who was staying upstairs and died while unattended in the bathtub.  Hoffman shared that in another version of the story, “A Lady of the Evening was distraught over unrequited love of one of her clients and she took a bath and drank a bottle of gin and passed out and drowned.” However, most seem to think the ghost is a child as they have got the sensation of someone wanting to ride on their shoulders or putting a small hand into theirs.Over the years there have been other stories of ghostly presence at the location, such as unexplained footsteps and, when there was a pool hall at the location, how when it was unlocked for business one day,  instead of the cleaned pool hall, cues, etc. were strung all over. In Pompton Lakes, Laura Jennings, a member of the historic commission there, shared about some caring spirits at the Schuyler Colfax house ( Hamburg turnpike, Wayne)  “Dr. Jane Colfax Young grew up in the house with her father (Dr. Richard S. Colfax) and Aunt (also Dr. Jane Colfax). Katherine Young, daughter to Jane Colfax Young, shared that she spent a lot of time in the home until he was ten years old. Both her and her father felt and saw things in the house that they are sure were the spirits of their ancestors watching over them. The Colfax family is one of the founding families in the area.”Jennings also shared that she had heard reports of ghost sightings at the Lenox School in Pompton Plains.Morristown has had its own dealing with the paranormal.  Pat Goodfriend, Membership & Volunteer Coordinator for the Morris County Historical Society shared a short 2016 article by Y. McGreevy on Ford Mansion. The mansion at the Morristown National Historical Park is over 200 years old.  Once the home of George Washington (briefly during 1780), the mansion drew the interest of Gordon Thomas Ward, a paranormal investigator, who in 2016, did a presentation on the Mansion and his two-year study of it, including the noises said to be coming from inside its walls.  An article by B. LaMuraglia the same year shows that during the time of his investigation, Ward heard the voices of three male and two female spirits.  None were Washington; Ward felt at least one could have been a kitchen servant. Bells Mansion, near the Netcong-Stanhope border has also been the subject of a paranormal study.  That was shared by Tom Lupo of Hopatcong, a producer who followed the NJ Ghost Hunters Society when it investigated the restaurant six years ago.  The segment includes a worker recalling seeing the spirit of a woman. He was cleaning up after the restaurant had closed. There are windows between the rooms.  He looked up and saw a woman, seated in the next room, looking out at the road. He watched her for about 10 seconds and then went to approach her. When he walked into that room, she was gone. This Halloween, will the Hooker Man or the little girl ghost at Bea McNally’s be seen?  Will voices whisper through Ford Mansion or the Lenox School? Perhaps, this year, a new spirit will be seen and its legend begun. Hauntings Around the Area for Halloween added by new_view_media on October 1, 2019View all posts by new_view_media →\n"
