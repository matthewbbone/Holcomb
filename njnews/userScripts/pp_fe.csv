Detectives found a blank gun and bandana that they said Jairrod Shannon 18 used during the Oct. 5 holdup on Bogert Street Police Chief Glenn M. O’Reilly said. Officers responding to rounds fired from the blank gun found a 20-year-old woman and 17-year-old boy who said they’d been robbed during a pot deal by Shannon and a juvenile O’Reilly said. A warrant was issued for Shannon’s arrest and a search warrant was obtained for his home the chief said. SWAT team members joined Teaneck police in a subsequent raid on the residence last Friday. Police found the Ekol Botan 9mm blank-firing handgun along with a pair of glasses and a bandana that the victims said Shannon was wearing during the robbery. The 6-foot-1-inch 160-pound Shannon – who was arrested on drug possession charges in June -- was sent to the Bergen County Jail on charges of armed robbery using a juvenile to commit a crime and illegal weapons possession. A judge subsequently refused Shannon’s request to release him and ordered that he remain held pending further court action. Authorities were looking for his underage accomplice.

Photo Credit: Facebook Highclere Castle Gin Previous Articles Highclere Castle Spirits Highclere Castle Gin Evokes The Elegance Of A Time Gone By See More Articles from Highclere Castle Spirits They say the third time is the charm. But sometimes the fourth 10th and even the 24th don’t fit the bill. Ask Adam von Gootkin. When it came to creating the right recipe for Highclere Castle Gin to say the Highclere Castle Spirits CEO was picky is an understatement. “We took about a year to develop the recipe” said von Gootkin. “I was adamant that it had to be a product that I personally would love.” Call it kismet fate or plain luck but everything needed to create Highclere Castle Gin ended up being right at Highclere Castle itself best known as television and film’s Downton Abbey. “Walking through the gardens at Highclere is where the recipe really happened” said von Gootkin. The recipe was designed in the Monks Garden out back in a matter of half an hour said von Gootkin. The beautifully fragrant oranges of the Victorian-era orangery beckoned. Nearby so too did the lavender which had been planted on the grounds back in the ninth century by the bishops of Winchester. Other botanicals made the list as well. And then there was the juniper—after all you can’t have gin without juniper berries—grown on the estate since Ancient Roman times. Von Gootkin recalled: We gave that list to the team at our distillery and started playing around. The very first thing I decided was to pull back on that juniper a bit. I didn’t want it to be a pine-heavy juniper-heavy gin as so many of them are. We went back and forth so many times: ‘a little less lavender’ ‘a little more citrus’ ‘let’s smell the orange peel without necessarily tasting it’ ‘let’s have a creamier finish.’ Finding that soft finish was the final challenge. “The 24th iteration was 95 percent there and we really liked it” said von Gootkin. “I was so close to saying ‘it’s good roll with it.’ But then Lord Carnarvon spirits partner and owner of Highclere Castle suggested throwing some oats in.” Not just any oats are used mind you but Highclere Castle Oats grown on the estate for horse and human consumption and the feed of choice to 560 and counting winning racehorses and show jumpers among others. A glass container with only “25” written on it arrived via Fedex direct from the distillery several days later that summer of 2018. Lord Carnarvon happened to be stateside with von Gootkin at the time. They found tonic in the hotel suite’s bar and called down for limes to give number 25 a try in a classic gin and tonic. “We just knew as soon as we tried it that this was it” said von Gootkin. He continued: Our gin has that long pillowy soft velvet finish. It’s difficult and rare to get that in a spirit. With most you’re tasting them and ending with an alcohol base but with Highclere Castle Gin you have eight long seconds where you can keep extracting different flavors on the palate almost like what happens with wines. And I think a lot of that has to do with the oats. Patience perseverance and a lot of trial and error proved to be key in creating this unique super-premium London dry gin. So toast the oats the bishops of Winchester and even the Romans when you enjoy your own Highclere Castle Gin. Visit Highclere Castle Gin for more information.

Finding that soft finish was the final challenge.

“The 24th iteration was 95 percent there, and we really liked it,” said von Gootkin. “I was so close to saying ‘it’s good, roll with it.’ But then Lord Carnarvon, spirits partner and owner of Highclere Castle, suggested throwing some oats in.”

Not just any oats are used, mind you, but Highclere Castle Oats, grown on the estate for horse (and human) consumption and the feed of choice to 560 (and counting) winning racehorses and show jumpers, among others.

A glass container with only “25” written on it arrived via Fedex direct from the distillery several days later that summer of 2018. Lord Carnarvon happened to be stateside with von Gootkin at the time. They found tonic in the hotel suite’s bar and called down for limes to give number 25 a try in a classic gin and tonic.

“We just knew as soon as we tried it that this was it,” said von Gootkin. He continued:

Our gin has that long, pillowy, soft velvet finish. It’s difficult and rare to get that in a spirit. With most, you’re tasting them and ending with an alcohol base, but with Highclere Castle Gin you have eight long seconds where you can keep extracting different flavors on the palate, almost like what happens with wines. And I think a lot of that has to do with the oats.

Patience, perseverance and a lot of trial and error proved to be key in creating this unique super-premium London dry gin. So toast the oats, the bishops of Winchester and even the Romans when you enjoy your own Highclere Castle Gin.

Visit Highclere Castle Gin for more information."

Muhic was South Jersey Sports Weekly’s Player of the Week. Moorestown senior goalkeeper Kevin Muhic allowed just one goal in four games to lead the Quakers to a Coaches Tournament title. MIKE MONOSTRA South Jersey Sports Weekly “We’re a very determined motivated group ready to prove something” Muhic said prior to Moorestown’s win over Clearview. “I think this was a great chance. This is a goal we worked toward making it to Coaches Cup. Having the chance to play these top teams in South Jersey everyone has been at their best performance.” Moorestown 14-5-2 has 10 shutout victories this season. “He has kept us in every game” Moorestown coach Mike Randall said. “First at Eastern he made a couple of great saves at home. But at St. Augustine he might have made five or six point-blank reaction saves that kept us in that game. At one point we could have easily been down 2-0 in that game if not for Kevin. He came up huge. The one time he came flying across the goal and gets the ball in his chest. The next time he gets it in his hands. He had one on the near post he gets with his hands. Kid goes to kick it he gets up gets it with his hands again and then gets up one more time and picks it up from the kid. Shutouts are one thing but it’s how you get the shutouts. He’s been playing with a ton of confidence.” *** ICYMI: Stories from Last Week Eastern High School junior Riley Tiernan and sophomore Ryleigh Heck. RYAN LAWRENCE South Jersey Sports Weekly As we mentioned Eastern girls soccer also won a Coaches Tournament title on Saturday. The Vikings are ranked No.1 in the country according to USA Today. But what’s even more interesting: Eastern has two female teams in the fall that have been ranked No.1 in the country this season as its perennial field hockey powerhouse is making a math toward a 21st straight state championship. We caught up with Riley Tiernan of the soccer team and Ryleigh Heck of the field hockey team for a fun Q&A about the school’s success. Moorestown Friends girls tennis team didn’t collect a Tournament of Champions trophy last week. But what the Foxes have done in the last two years won’t be forgotten anytime soon. Mike Monostra checked in with the two-time defending Non-Public B state champions to recap their memorable run. Cross country season is kicking into high gear as the fall season draws to a close in the next month. The best of the best in the Olympic Conference showed off their stuff in the conference meet at DREAM Park in Logan Township last week with Cherokee and Cherry Hill East playing starring roles.

“Highclere Castle has been renowned for its entertaining and house parties featuring gin cocktails through the years,” said Lady Carnarvon, the eighth Countess of Carnarvon and best-selling author of At Home at Highclere: Entertaining at the Real Downton Abbey. “We, therefore, felt that with the ever-rising interest in gin, the family’s heritage and indeed the Carnarvon’s love of the spirit, that it was a natural step to make a gin from Highclere provenance.”

Photo Credit: Facebook Highclere Castle Gin Previous Articles Highclere Castle Spirits Highclere Castle Gin Evokes The Elegance Of A Time Gone By See More Articles from Highclere Castle Spirits They say the third time is the charm. But sometimes the fourth 10th and even the 24th don’t fit the bill. Ask Adam von Gootkin. When it came to creating the right recipe for Highclere Castle Gin to say the Highclere Castle Spirits CEO was picky is an understatement. “We took about a year to develop the recipe” said von Gootkin. “I was adamant that it had to be a product that I personally would love.” Call it kismet fate or plain luck but everything needed to create Highclere Castle Gin ended up being right at Highclere Castle itself best known as television and film’s Downton Abbey. “Walking through the gardens at Highclere is where the recipe really happened” said von Gootkin. The recipe was designed in the Monks Garden out back in a matter of half an hour said von Gootkin. The beautifully fragrant oranges of the Victorian-era orangery beckoned. Nearby so too did the lavender which had been planted on the grounds back in the ninth century by the bishops of Winchester. Other botanicals made the list as well. And then there was the juniper—after all you can’t have gin without juniper berries—grown on the estate since Ancient Roman times. Von Gootkin recalled: We gave that list to the team at our distillery and started playing around. The very first thing I decided was to pull back on that juniper a bit. I didn’t want it to be a pine-heavy juniper-heavy gin as so many of them are. We went back and forth so many times: ‘a little less lavender’ ‘a little more citrus’ ‘let’s smell the orange peel without necessarily tasting it’ ‘let’s have a creamier finish.’ Finding that soft finish was the final challenge. “The 24th iteration was 95 percent there and we really liked it” said von Gootkin. “I was so close to saying ‘it’s good roll with it.’ But then Lord Carnarvon spirits partner and owner of Highclere Castle suggested throwing some oats in.” Not just any oats are used mind you but Highclere Castle Oats grown on the estate for horse and human consumption and the feed of choice to 560 and counting winning racehorses and show jumpers among others. A glass container with only “25” written on it arrived via Fedex direct from the distillery several days later that summer of 2018. Lord Carnarvon happened to be stateside with von Gootkin at the time. They found tonic in the hotel suite’s bar and called down for limes to give number 25 a try in a classic gin and tonic. “We just knew as soon as we tried it that this was it” said von Gootkin. He continued: Our gin has that long pillowy soft velvet finish. It’s difficult and rare to get that in a spirit. With most you’re tasting them and ending with an alcohol base but with Highclere Castle Gin you have eight long seconds where you can keep extracting different flavors on the palate almost like what happens with wines. And I think a lot of that has to do with the oats. Patience perseverance and a lot of trial and error proved to be key in creating this unique super-premium London dry gin. So toast the oats the bishops of Winchester and even the Romans when you enjoy your own Highclere Castle Gin. Visit Highclere Castle Gin for more information.

",25th Time Is The Charm: Finding The Perfect Recipe For Highclere Castle Gin,2019-10-02 17:43:00-04:00,,"They say the third time is the charm. But sometimes, the fourth, 10th and even the 24th don’t fit the bill.

Ask Adam von Gootkin. When it came to creating the right recipe for Highclere Castle Gin, to say the Highclere Castle Spirits CEO was picky is an understatement.

“We took about a year to develop the recipe,” said von Gootkin. “I was adamant that it had to be a product that I personally would love.”

“Walking through the gardens at Highclere is where the recipe really happened,” said von Gootkin.

""The recipe was designed in the Monks Garden out back in a matter of half an hour,"" said von Gootkin.

Patricia Buchan 29 struck a plea deal in which she will face up to five years in prison when she's sentenced in December. On Dec. 4 2018 Buchan was watching the three-year-old at her home in the 200 block of Clinton Avenue when the boy urinated on the floor of Buchan's son's room. Buchan is not related to the victim. She ordered the boy to get undressed and get into the bathtub then took a pot of boiling water from the stove and poured it on him. The child suffered second-degree burns to the lower part of his body. Authorities learned of the abuse from Newark preschool officials. “This child lived his first three years in a house of horrors’’ said Assistant Prosecutor Michael Morris. “Today’s plea resolves the case without the ordeal of the children having to testify.” The boy lived in the home with four of Buchan's children as well as a sixth child. Buchan who was pregnant when the incident occurred now has a fifth child. Buchan also shared the home with five other adults who were also arrested: Natacha Smith 44 the mother of the victim; Buchan's mother Mary 56; Buchan's aunt Patricia Gamarra 63; Buchan's sister Bridget 24; and Smith's boyfriend Homer Searcy 40. They were all charged with aggravated assault and endangering the welfare of a child. The other adults have been indicted and their cases are pending.

At the October meeting the board reviewed architectural plans prepared by Garrison Architects that were subsequently submitted to the appropriate state and local agencies for approval. On January 28 2020 Mantua Township residents will vote on two questions regarding capital improvements for all Mantua Township Schools. The improvement plans for “Mantua 2021: Taking our schools from good to great” are split into two questions: Question 1 project highlights include renovations at all three school buildings. All schools will be outfitted with security vestibules transaction windows technology upgrades for safety and HVAC equipment replacements. Sewell Elementary School and J. Mason Tomlin Elementary School will have gym floors that are emitting mercury removed and replaced. An addition at Sewell Elementary School will house additional kindergarten classrooms and the relocation of the administrative offices. A detailed plan of all work can be found here. The total estimated cost of the projects in Question 1 is $9650000. If voters approve this question there will be no tax impact for residents due to debt expiring in 2020. Question 2 includes $1385250 in additional improvements at all three schools. Sewell Elementary School projects include the construction of ADA accessible prekindergarten classroom bathrooms as well as the removal and replacement of carpet with non-allergenic floor tile.

",4-Year-Old Found Safe After Walking Out Of Nutley Preschool Alone: Police,2019-11-08 14:22:00-05:00,,"This story was updated Sunday, Nov. 10 with information on the school involved.

A toddler was found safe in Nutley after the child left a daycare unattended on Monday, police said.

A Good Samaritan spotted the child near Vreeland and Franklin avenues and stayed with the child until officers arrived, police said. The child was unharmed and was reunited with the parents, police also said.

Authorities believe the child walked out an open door and crossed High Street.

A Nutley police spokesman declined to provide much information about the incident, including the name of the facility or when staff became aware of the child's disappearance. There are a number of preschools in the general area.

The spokesman did say the incident is under investigation with the help of an assisting agency.

Photo Credit: Facebook Highclere Castle Gin Previous Articles Highclere Castle Spirits Highclere Castle Gin Evokes The Elegance Of A Time Gone By See More Articles from Highclere Castle Spirits They say the third time is the charm. But sometimes the fourth 10th and even the 24th don’t fit the bill. Ask Adam von Gootkin. When it came to creating the right recipe for Highclere Castle Gin to say the Highclere Castle Spirits CEO was picky is an understatement. “We took about a year to develop the recipe” said von Gootkin. “I was adamant that it had to be a product that I personally would love.” Call it kismet fate or plain luck but everything needed to create Highclere Castle Gin ended up being right at Highclere Castle itself best known as television and film’s Downton Abbey. “Walking through the gardens at Highclere is where the recipe really happened” said von Gootkin. The recipe was designed in the Monks Garden out back in a matter of half an hour said von Gootkin. The beautifully fragrant oranges of the Victorian-era orangery beckoned. Nearby so too did the lavender which had been planted on the grounds back in the ninth century by the bishops of Winchester. Other botanicals made the list as well. And then there was the juniper—after all you can’t have gin without juniper berries—grown on the estate since Ancient Roman times. Von Gootkin recalled: We gave that list to the team at our distillery and started playing around. The very first thing I decided was to pull back on that juniper a bit. I didn’t want it to be a pine-heavy juniper-heavy gin as so many of them are. We went back and forth so many times: ‘a little less lavender’ ‘a little more citrus’ ‘let’s smell the orange peel without necessarily tasting it’ ‘let’s have a creamier finish.’ Finding that soft finish was the final challenge. “The 24th iteration was 95 percent there and we really liked it” said von Gootkin. “I was so close to saying ‘it’s good roll with it.’ But then Lord Carnarvon spirits partner and owner of Highclere Castle suggested throwing some oats in.” Not just any oats are used mind you but Highclere Castle Oats grown on the estate for horse and human consumption and the feed of choice to 560 and counting winning racehorses and show jumpers among others. A glass container with only “25” written on it arrived via Fedex direct from the distillery several days later that summer of 2018. Lord Carnarvon happened to be stateside with von Gootkin at the time. They found tonic in the hotel suite’s bar and called down for limes to give number 25 a try in a classic gin and tonic. “We just knew as soon as we tried it that this was it” said von Gootkin. He continued: Our gin has that long pillowy soft velvet finish. It’s difficult and rare to get that in a spirit. With most you’re tasting them and ending with an alcohol base but with Highclere Castle Gin you have eight long seconds where you can keep extracting different flavors on the palate almost like what happens with wines. And I think a lot of that has to do with the oats. Patience perseverance and a lot of trial and error proved to be key in creating this unique super-premium London dry gin. So toast the oats the bishops of Winchester and even the Romans when you enjoy your own Highclere Castle Gin. Visit Highclere Castle Gin for more information.

",25th Time Is The Charm: Finding The Perfect Recipe For Highclere Castle Gin,2019-10-02 17:43:00-04:00,,"They say the third time is the charm. But sometimes, the fourth, 10th and even the 24th don’t fit the bill.

Photo Credit: Facebook Highclere Castle Gin Previous Articles Highclere Castle Spirits Highclere Castle Gin Evokes The Elegance Of A Time Gone By See More Articles from Highclere Castle Spirits They say the third time is the charm. But sometimes the fourth 10th and even the 24th don’t fit the bill. Ask Adam von Gootkin. When it came to creating the right recipe for Highclere Castle Gin to say the Highclere Castle Spirits CEO was picky is an understatement. “We took about a year to develop the recipe” said von Gootkin. “I was adamant that it had to be a product that I personally would love.” Call it kismet fate or plain luck but everything needed to create Highclere Castle Gin ended up being right at Highclere Castle itself best known as television and film’s Downton Abbey. “Walking through the gardens at Highclere is where the recipe really happened” said von Gootkin. The recipe was designed in the Monks Garden out back in a matter of half an hour said von Gootkin. The beautifully fragrant oranges of the Victorian-era orangery beckoned. Nearby so too did the lavender which had been planted on the grounds back in the ninth century by the bishops of Winchester. Other botanicals made the list as well. And then there was the juniper—after all you can’t have gin without juniper berries—grown on the estate since Ancient Roman times. Von Gootkin recalled: We gave that list to the team at our distillery and started playing around. The very first thing I decided was to pull back on that juniper a bit. I didn’t want it to be a pine-heavy juniper-heavy gin as so many of them are. We went back and forth so many times: ‘a little less lavender’ ‘a little more citrus’ ‘let’s smell the orange peel without necessarily tasting it’ ‘let’s have a creamier finish.’ Finding that soft finish was the final challenge. “The 24th iteration was 95 percent there and we really liked it” said von Gootkin. “I was so close to saying ‘it’s good roll with it.’ But then Lord Carnarvon spirits partner and owner of Highclere Castle suggested throwing some oats in.” Not just any oats are used mind you but Highclere Castle Oats grown on the estate for horse and human consumption and the feed of choice to 560 and counting winning racehorses and show jumpers among others. A glass container with only “25” written on it arrived via Fedex direct from the distillery several days later that summer of 2018.

",25th Time Is The Charm: Finding The Perfect Recipe For Highclere Castle Gin,2019-10-02 17:43:00-04:00,,"They say the third time is the charm. But sometimes, the fourth, 10th and even the 24th don’t fit the bill.

Ask Adam von Gootkin. When it came to creating the right recipe for Highclere Castle Gin, to say the Highclere Castle Spirits CEO was picky is an understatement.

“We took about a year to develop the recipe,” said von Gootkin. “I was adamant that it had to be a product that I personally would love.”

Call it kismet, fate or plain luck, but everything needed to create Highclere Castle Gin ended up being right at Highclere Castle itself, best known as television and film’s Downton Abbey.

“Walking through the gardens at Highclere is where the recipe really happened,” said von Gootkin.

""The recipe was designed in the Monks Garden out back in a matter of half an hour,"" said von Gootkin.

The beautifully fragrant oranges of the Victorian-era orangery beckoned. Nearby, so too did the lavender, which had been planted on the grounds back in the ninth century by the bishops of Winchester. Other botanicals made the list as well. And then there was the juniper—after all, you can’t have gin without juniper berries—grown on the estate since Ancient Roman times. Von Gootkin recalled:

We gave that list to the team at our distillery and started playing around. The very first thing I decided was to pull back on that juniper a bit. I didn’t want it to be a pine-heavy, juniper-heavy gin as so many of them are. We went back and forth so many times: ‘a little less lavender,’ ‘a little more citrus,’ ‘let’s smell the orange peel without necessarily tasting it,’ ‘let’s have a creamier finish.’

Finding that soft finish was the final challenge.

“The 24th iteration was 95 percent there, and we really liked it,” said von Gootkin. “I was so close to saying ‘it’s good, roll with it.’ But then Lord Carnarvon, spirits partner and owner of Highclere Castle, suggested throwing some oats in.”

Not just any oats are used, mind you, but Highclere Castle Oats, grown on the estate for horse (and human) consumption and the feed of choice to 560 (and counting) winning racehorses and show jumpers, among others.

A glass container with only “25” written on it arrived via Fedex direct from the distillery several days later that summer of 2018. Lord Carnarvon happened to be stateside with von Gootkin at the time. They found tonic in the hotel suite’s bar and called down for limes to give number 25 a try in a classic gin and tonic.

“We just knew as soon as we tried it that this was it,” said von Gootkin. He continued:

Our gin has that long, pillowy, soft velvet finish. It’s difficult and rare to get that in a spirit. With most, you’re tasting them and ending with an alcohol base, but with Highclere Castle Gin you have eight long seconds where you can keep extracting different flavors on the palate, almost like what happens with wines. And I think a lot of that has to do with the oats.

Patience, perseverance and a lot of trial and error proved to be key in creating this unique super-premium London dry gin. So toast the oats, the bishops of Winchester and even the Romans when you enjoy your own Highclere Castle Gin.

By KRYSTAL NURSE - November 6 2019 Facebook Twitter Email Print Bob Barrall 92 poses with images from his time in and after his service in the Navy. When Medford Lakes resident Bob Barrall found himself in the Navy at the end of World War II the experience helped reshape his life. Private First Class Barrall served in the Navy from 1944 to 1946. However stationed in Hawaii right after Pearl Harbor Barrall never saw war action. “Like everybody in the service they were very happy to get out” Barrall said. “Nobody wanted to be there and it was because when you were in the Army Navy or Marines they took you out of the streets somewhere and put you there because there’s a war. You had to learn a lot of things about the service.” The 92-year-old said when he was sent to Treasure Island in California before being stationed in Hawaii many of the men had no idea where they were going and had to remain as quiet as possible due to the possibility of enemy submarines Japan Italy and Germany being in the area. In Barrall’s case he wasn’t old enough to enlist in the military on his own but was able to do so after his father and Army veteran Edward Barrall gave permission. Barrall took a chance in life and left high school after completing his junior year to serve. “I was one of those guys that didn’t want to go to school and there were a lot of guys like me” he added. Enlistment for Barrall occurred at the height of the war which helped him decide with which branch to enlist. “People in the Army were getting killed and people were getting killed too in the Navy but my thinking was if they sink my ship I can swim” he joked. “Only a kid can think of those kind of things.” His path in the Navy however took an interesting turn as the ranking officers sent him to the kitchen to be a cook for the “30000-some people on the island.” The officers learned of his parents’ experience in baking sticky buns and Bavarian bread in a Pennsylvania Dutch bakery and figured Barrall must’ve picked up on those skills growing up. There he comically found his favorite “weapon” of choice…a spatula. “My family had a bakery underneath our house and one of those Pennsylvania Dutch jobs where they make Bavarian bread and sticky buns and my job was to hop on my bike with a basket in front of it and it was loaded with bread some sticky buns and I would ride it down the street and drop it off at places” he said. The port Pearl Harbor was rebuilt shortly following the bombing he said because it was and still is the home of the Navy’s telecommunications. From that base messages were sent out to other branches of service and the Allied Forces. Following his two years in the Navy Barrall went back to finish high school and later attended East Stroudsburg University for a teaching certificate. The veteran taught for one year at Lower Camden County Regional High School which is now known as Eastern Regional High School and for an additional three years in Berlin Borough’s school district. “The last year I taught I was being paid poorly and teachers were being paid poorly too but it was the only thing I knew” Barrall said. “I didn’t have all of the qualifications to get here or there.” He found his way to Pfiezer informing doctors about how certain medications will treat patients’ ailments and if they will interact negatively with one another. He admitted he didn’t know there was a calling for people like him that knew that type of knowledge and stuck with the profession for roughly 30 years. As time progresses Barrall said he believes it wouldn’t hurt for younger eligible kids to participate in the five branches of service Army Marines Navy Coast Guard and National Guard in some shape or form. “When you go to grade school and college you learn what they want to teach you” he added. “What you learn in the service is something you don’t learn from books. There’s an education out there that’s built for people in what you can’t get from books. You have to be out in the world and see it.“ TAGS bob barrall medford-lakes u.s. navy veteran Facebook Twitter Email Print KRYSTAL NURSE RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Code Blue activated for frigid temperatures Lower Forge hosting presentation on recycling sustainability Annual ‘Thanks-Giving’ breakfast set for Nov. 27 Medford Lakes clear sky enter location 63.4 ° F 67 ° 59 ° 42 % 1.1mph 1 % Mon 62 ° Tue 58 ° Wed 33 ° Thu 45 ° Fri 48 ° Archives Archives Select Month November 2019  140 October 2019  422 September 2019  343 August 2019  397 July 2019  413 June 2019  454 May 2019  550 April 2019  522 March 2019  730 February 2019  734 January 2019  790 December 2018  710 November 2018  786 October 2018  840 September 2018  734 August 2018  667 July 2018  771 June 2018  729 May 2018  790 April 2018  703 March 2018  770 February 2018  771 January 2018  896 December 2017  716 November 2017  752 October 2017  866 September 2017  843 August 2017  804 July 2017  804 June 2017  872 May 2017  855 April 2017  792 March 2017  1002 February 2017  772 January 2017  655 December 2016  544 November 2016  588 October 2016  503 September 2016  394 August 2016  364 July 2016  325 June 2016  310 May 2016  301 April 2016  369 March 2016  375 February 2016  317 January 2016  333 December 2015  338 November 2015  339 October 2015  379 September 2015  350 August 2015  318 July 2015  376 June 2015  379 May 2015  346 April 2015  381 March 2015  391 February 2015  350 January 2015  357 December 2014  311 November 2014  260 October 2014  327 September 2014  291 August 2014  251 July 2014  297 June 2014  293 May 2014  318 April 2014  327 March 2014  354 February 2014  313 January 2014  399 December 2013  341 November 2013  324 October 2013  367 September 2013  311 August 2013  286 July 2013  318 June 2013  367 May 2013  386 April 2013  417 March 2013  416 February 2013  382 January 2013  435 December 2012  358 November 2012  205 October 2012  270 September 2012  174 August 2012  154 July 2012  175 June 2012  193 May 2012  185 April 2012  170 March 2012  139 February 2012  172 January 2012  147 December 2011  183 November 2011  210 October 2011  163 September 2011  224 August 2011  238 July 2011  420 June 2011  78 May 2011  318 April 2011  176 March 2011  327 February 2011  227 January 2011  133 December 2010  129 November 2010  36 October 2010  30 September 2010  33 August 2010  25 July 2010  98 June 2010  107 May 2010  71 April 2010  47 March 2010  120 February 2010  36 January 2010  60 December 2009  24 November 2009  34 October 2009  28 September 2009  21 August 2009  46 July 2009  56 June 2009  81 May 2009  85 April 2009  91 March 2009  14 ABOUT USWe publish over 50 community publications Two Executive Campus Suite 400 Cherry Hill NJ 08002 856-779-3800 8:30a-5:30p M-F NewspaperMediaGroup.com Contact us: webmaster@newspapermediagroup.com The Sun Newspapers Berlin Sun Burlington Twp Sun Cherry Hill Sun Cinnaminson Sun Delran Sun Deptford Sun Haddonfield Sun Mantua Sun Marlton Sun Medford Sun Moorestown Sun Mt Laurel Sun Mullica Hill Sun Palmyra Sun Shamong Sun Sicklerville Sun Tabernacle Sun Voorhees Sun Washington Twp Sun Williamstown Sun Contact Us Privacy Policy Terms of Use © 2019 – The Sun Newspapers

See More Articles from Oritani Bank The goal of many con artists is the acquisition of financial information that can allow them to victimize unsuspecting individuals. A con artist often targets specific groups of people who possess certain characteristics and attributes that will make the fraud easier to execute like age and financial stability but anyone can be a target of con artists. Below is some great information to help safeguard you and your financial information against fraud. Targeting in Multiple Ways A con artist generally has multiple approaches to conning people out of money. Con artists most often use the U.S. Mail telephone and phishing emails to lure unsuspecting victims to the con. Telemarketing Scams The telemarketing scam entails a con artist calling an unsuspecting person and trying to sell a product or service that does not exist. To make the telemarketing scam successful the con artist aims for people who will likely believe the sales pitch or may fear they will miss a great opportunity. The telemarketing scam can play out in one of a few ways. First the telemarketer may push the person who answers the phone to make a hasty decision by stating an offer is good for a limited time so quick action is required to benefit from the deal. Another scam involves an individual receiving phone calls announcing they have won a trip lottery sweepstakes or other valuable prize. The caller then tries to elicit personal information including banking details. In reality there is no trip and no prize and people who relinquish their bank information are exposed to the possibility of their accounts being accessed without their authority. Contact your bank immediately if you believe you have given sensitive information to a potential con artist. Mail Scams People who do not collect their mail consistently are prime targets of these scams as mail has important information like bank account numbers credit card account numbers and personal information which can easily be stolen without their knowledge. When con artists gain access to this information they will make their plans for the potential scam. Mail scams involve either stealing bank or other financial information or sending an invitation to claim a prize. Arming Yourself with Knowledge To protect yourself from scams and other types of fraud knowledge is necessary. Knowing what to watch for is half the battle. Here is some helpful information to keep in mind to avoid becoming a victim of financial crime: Mail Fraud Use electronic bill pay services instead of mailing checks. Enroll in your bank’s daily activity notice feature. Remove the mail from your box every day. If you are traveling have your mail held until you return. Notify your post office of a change of address immediately. Use U.S. Postal Service mailboxes inside facilities to send mail. Ask a trusted neighbor to take in your mail when you are unavailable to do so yourself. Consider receiving statements containing financial information via your secure email. Contact the issuer of a check if you do not receive it in a timely fashion. If you suspect someone has stolen your mail report it immediately to the Postmaster. By reducing the opportunities for con artists to gather your financial information it is less likely you will become the victim of fraud. Stopping Telemarketing Fraud When you receive a telemarketing call listen for these key words or phrases that indicate you need to end the call. “You need to act now to get this deal.” “The offer is only good for a short time.” “You cannot miss this offer.” “You have won a free prize gift vacation etc..” The caller will often ask you to provide personal information including the name of your bank and account number. Never answer questions about personal information over the phone simply tell the caller that you are not interested and hang up. More Helpful Information It is important to monitor your bank statements and credit card transactions for any unauthorized charges on a daily basis if possible. If you find anything suspicious report it to the bank credit card company and the appropriate authorities. If telemarketers continually call you add your phone number to the Do Not Call Registry at donotcall.gov. If the telemarketer ignores the “Do Not Call Registry” you can report them via the complaints section of donotcall.gov or by calling 1-888-382-1222.

",Stopping Fraud: Oritani Bank Offers Advice On How To Protect Yourself,2019-09-16 07:45:04.716235-04:00,,"The goal of many con artists is the acquisition of financial information that can allow them to victimize unsuspecting individuals. A con artist often targets specific groups of people who possess certain characteristics and attributes that will make the fraud easier to execute, like age and financial stability, but anyone can be a target of con artists. Below is some great information to help safeguard you and your financial information against fraud.

Targeting in Multiple Ways

A con artist generally has multiple approaches to conning people out of money. Con artists most often use the U.S. Mail, telephone and phishing emails to lure unsuspecting victims to the con.

Telemarketing Scams

The telemarketing scam entails a con artist calling an unsuspecting person and trying to sell a product or service that does not exist. To make the telemarketing scam successful, the con artist aims for people who will likely believe the sales pitch or may fear they will miss a great opportunity.

The telemarketing scam can play out in one of a few ways. First, the telemarketer may push the person who answers the phone to make a hasty decision by stating an offer is good for a limited time, so quick action is required to benefit from the deal. Another scam involves an individual receiving phone calls announcing they have won a trip, lottery, sweepstakes or other valuable prize. The caller then tries to elicit personal information, including banking details. In reality, there is no trip and no prize, and people who relinquish their bank information are exposed to the possibility of their accounts being accessed without their authority. Contact your bank immediately if you believe you have given sensitive information to a potential con artist.

Mail Scams

People who do not collect their mail consistently are prime targets of these scams, as mail has important information like bank account numbers, credit card account numbers and personal information which can easily be stolen without their knowledge. When con artists gain access to this information, they will make their plans for the potential scam. Mail scams involve either stealing bank or other financial information or sending an invitation to claim a prize.

Arming Yourself with Knowledge

To protect yourself from scams and other types of fraud, knowledge is necessary. Knowing what to watch for is half the battle. Here is some helpful information to keep in mind to avoid becoming a victim of financial crime:

Use electronic bill pay services instead of mailing checks.





Enroll in your bank’s daily activity notice feature.





Remove the mail from your box every day. If you are traveling, have your mail held until you return.





Notify your post office of a change of address immediately.





Use U.S. Postal Service mailboxes inside facilities to send mail.

Consider receiving statements containing financial information via your secure email.





Contact the issuer of a check if you do not receive it in a timely fashion. If you suspect someone has stolen your mail, report it immediately to the Postmaster.

Mail Fraud

By reducing the opportunities for con artists to gather your financial information, it is less likely you will become the victim of fraud.

Stopping Telemarketing Fraud

When you receive a telemarketing call, listen for these key words or phrases that indicate you need to end the call.

“You need to act now to get this deal.”





“The offer is only good for a short time.”





“You cannot miss this offer.”





“You have won a free (prize, gift, vacation, etc.).”

The caller will often ask you to provide personal information including the name of your bank and account number. Never answer questions about personal information over the phone, simply tell the caller that you are not interested and hang up.

More Helpful Information

It is important to monitor your bank statements and credit card transactions for any unauthorized charges on a daily basis, if possible. If you find anything suspicious, report it to the bank, credit card company and the appropriate authorities. If telemarketers continually call you, add your phone number to the Do Not Call Registry at donotcall.gov. If the telemarketer ignores the “Do Not Call Registry” you can report them via the complaints section of donotcall.gov or by calling 1-888-382-1222.

“Highclere Castle has been renowned for its entertaining and house parties featuring gin cocktails through the years,” said Lady Carnarvon, the eighth Countess of Carnarvon and best-selling author of At Home at Highclere: Entertaining at the Real Downton Abbey. “We, therefore, felt that with the ever-rising interest in gin, the family’s heritage and indeed the Carnarvon’s love of the spirit, that it was a natural step to make a gin from Highclere provenance.”

Not a good thing. We were subjected daily to photos and news footage of people using magnifying glasses to stare at paper ballots. The year was 2000 and the leadership of the free world was at stake. George W. Bush vs. Al Gore. The race came down to Florida and then there were well issues when only a few hundred votes separated the candidates. Eventually after the U.S. Supreme Court got involved Bush as you know was declared the winner. We bring this up today not to rekindle bad memories but to point out that Oct. 15 is the last day to register to vote in the Nov. 5 general election and as you can see every vote at times really does count. Search the internet for “close elections” and you’ll see many elections that were hotly contested some to the point where a tie was declared and the eventual winner’s name pulled out of a hat. That’s not ideal. This year in addition to all 80 seats in the General Assembly a number of local contests are on the ballot across New Jersey. A lot is on the line both locally and nationally and the contests might be closer than one expects. That’s why registering to vote is important. Also it’s easy to do. Downloadable forms are online. Government offices  –  whose telephone numbers and websites also are online  –  stand ready to answer your questions and help you through the process. If you’re unsure how to register or you need information about voting by mail or something else reach out to your county clerk superintendent of elections or board of elections. Just do it quickly. The proper forms need to be in the proper hands soon. After that learn all you can about the issues and candidates and then show up at the polls on Nov. 5. Don’t leave these elections to chance.

",Sun Editorial: Register to vote,2019-10-08 00:00:00,The Sun Newspapers,"A lot of us are old enough to remember when “hanging chad” was a thing. Not a good thing. We were subjected daily to photos and news footage of people using magnifying glasses to stare at paper ballots.

The year was 2000, and the leadership of the free world was at stake. George W. Bush vs. Al Gore. The race came down to Florida, and then there were, well, issues, when only a few hundred votes separated the candidates. Eventually, after the U.S. Supreme Court got involved, Bush, as you know, was declared the winner.
